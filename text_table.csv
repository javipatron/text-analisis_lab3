1,"NEARLY £75 million will be invested in schemes to protect the world's oceans, the Government has said. Environment Secretary Therese Coffey made the announcement at the Our Ocean conference in Panama this week, where heads of state and the private sector discussed ways to protect the marine environment. Ms Coffey said £45 million will go towards a new ""Blue Tech Superhighway"" project, which aims to build collaboration between communities in Africa and Asia who would develop and share technologies to help fisheries become more climate resilient and less damaging to the oceans. The UK will also contribute £24million to the Global Fund for Coral Reefs and has become the first donor to the Blue Carbon Action Partnership, by offering £4million. The partnership is a collection of intergovernmental organisations, state ministries, environmental groups and scientists seeking to build stronger ""blue carbon"" ecosystems and economies. Blue carbon ecosystems are coastal environments with plants that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - such as mangrove trees, salt marshes and seagrass - which together are present on every continent on Earth except Antarctica. Ocean conservation groups have welcomed the news, but said the UK must strengthen the protection of marine areas at home and improve its relationships with developing countries to ensure that international negotiations to safeguard the oceans are successful. Ms Coffey said: ""It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of stepping up our efforts to bolster the resilience of the marine environment and, in turn, the economies and communities that depend on it. ""At the UN nature summit in Montreal, we made a commitment to manage our whole ocean sustainably and set a target to protect at least 30% of the world's ocean by 2030. ""The UK is leading, co-leading, and supporting global coalitions of ambition to drive forward this mission, and I urge countries to come together to deliver coordinated, impactful action on the ground."" The funding announcements will be drawn from the £154million Climate and Ocean Adaptation and Sustainable Transition programme (Coast) launched by Lord Goldsmith at the UN Ocean Conference in 2022. Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana UK, said: ""We welcome the UK's international work to tackle illegal fishing and also to fund some marine conservation initiatives globally, but this must be matched by action back home."" However, Megan Randles, Greenpeace UK political campaigner, said: ""These funds are pitiful and from an existing pot. ""Countries are in the final, critical, hours of talks at the UN to agree a Global Ocean Treaty - a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - but after Coffey's announcement this morning, you could be forgiven for wondering if the minister is even aware those negotiations are taking place.""

2,"Cologny: World Economic Forum has issued the following press release: Restoring coastal ecosystems could result in a return of $11.8 billion in carbon finance by 2040.While private sector actors increasingly demand carbon credit investments, the blue carbon credit supply is still lacking.The World Economic Forum launched the Blue Carbon Action Partnership to support national ambitions and drive the blue carbon market.Coastal wetlands – consisting of mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes – play a critical role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. These are estimated to sequester 4 to 10 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare annually and up to 10 times faster than tropical rainforests. Globally, coastal ecosystems contribute over $ 190 billion annually to blue carbon wealth. Financing their restoration could result in 380 million TCO2 of sequestration and a return of $11.8 billion in carbon finance by 2040. This is equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly 82 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles. It is unsurprising then that blue carbon is reaching the attention of leaders at the highest level, with the UN Secretary-General Executive Office flagging it as a top priority for ocean work in 2023 and G20 leaders visiting a mangrove forest during their summit in Bali. While private sector actors increasingly demand carbon credit investments to protect or restore blue ecosystems, the supply of these credits is lacking, leaving the opportunities for blue carbon untapped. Additionally, current policy frameworks around carbon markets lack clarity which has slowed down the development of blue carbon projects. DISCOVERWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about the ocean? Show more Beyond market opportunities, governments can use blue carbon to achieve their mitigation and adaptation goals under the Paris Agreement, but the commitments for conservation investment have not materialised at scale. As blue carbon gains more attention, only partnerships will produce progress. To fully realise its potential, the world must unite blue carbon actors at all levels to develop the science, policy, and financial mechanisms for scaling blue carbon ecosystem restoration and conservation. Have you read?How to follow Davos 2023From Davos 2022 to Davos 2023: The six themes then that have set the agenda nowHere are four ways local, national, and global stakeholders can work together for the future of blue carbon: 1) Invest in high-quality carbon projects Corporations are increasingly committing to net-zero objectives and even considering carbon offsets, substantially boosting the demand for blue carbon credits. Current carbon credit inventories are shrinking, and competition among corporate offset purchasers is high. On that account, new blue carbon projects can generate hundreds of thousands of credits to meet this growing demand. Nevertheless, we must ensure that the credits are grounded in credible science and that there are safeguards with equitable benefit sharing for communities. New frameworks are emerging to help both buyers and suppliers understand what projects ensure benefits for people and the planet. The High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles and Guidance released at UNFCCC COP 27, for example, provide a consistent and accepted approach to these objectives. 2) Give local leaders and communities access to the international market Many communities may already value their blue carbon ecosystems for fishing, livelihood, shoreline protection, and other benefits. Carbon, as an additional benefit, can unlock external finance opportunities for these ecosystems on top of their daily lived benefits. We can unlock high-integrity capital investment in blue carbon ecosystems by providing local communities access to the voluntary carbon market. This requires collaboration across communities, support organizations, and policy-makers to make access to markets easier for projects. DISCOVERWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about mangroves? Show more 3) Equip governments to achieve their Paris Agreement climate goals As countries begin to renew their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlining how they will achieve their goals under the Paris Agreement, many are including blue carbon in their NDCs for adaptation and mitigation. Deliberate national policies, regulations, and accounting approaches are needed to help these governments and those who have yet to include blue carbon in their NDCs to achieve such ambitions. Because blue carbon ecosystems span land and ocean, jurisdiction over these ecosystems can be confusing and policies challenging. Government support to clarify land tenure will streamline approaches to mainstreaming blue carbon. 4) Global partnerships Significant ambitions to achieve investment goals in blue carbon are also building, including the newly launched Mangrove Breakthrough. This partnership between the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions and the Global Mangrove Alliance aims to uncover $4 billion to secure the future of 15 million hectares of mangroves globally by 2030. Through collective action, the Mangrove Breakthrough project seeks to halt mangrove loss, restore half of the recent losses, double the protection globally, and ensure sustainable long-term finance for all existing mangroves. The International Partnership for Blue Carbon is another prime example. As a group of governments, non-governmental organizations, and research organizations, they aim to connect efforts across all members and leverage the great work already happening to support one another. In parallel, using the High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles and Guidance as a foundational document, the World Economic Forum will soon launch the Blue Carbon Action Partnership (BCAP). BCAP supports national blue carbon ambitions and convenes partners to help tackle international challenges and drive the blue carbon market forward. Partnerships at all levels – from local to global, across all sectors – will allow us to unlock blue carbon ecosystems' potential to benefit people, biodiversity, and the planet.

3,"Cologny: World Economic Forum has issued the following press release: Coastal and marine ecosystems can store up to five times as much carbon per acre as tropical rainforests.Blue carbon credits invest in the protection of these systems, preserving the natural world while also reducing or preventing carbon emissions.The World Economic Forum ’ s Friends of Ocean Action, Salesforce and others have produced the High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles & Guidance to ensure that blue carbon stakeholders are engaging the market effectively and with integrity.Coastal and marine ecosystems such as mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and salt marshes can store, on average, more carbon per acre than terrestrial forests — but they have only recently emerged as a resource for generating carbon credits. Investing in blue carbon projects and credits will help protect these unique aquatic ecosystems — an end in itself — but also ensure the vast quantities of carbon they have sequestered from the atmosphere stays under water. If the world is to meet the ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and limit global warming to 1.5 °C or achieve the UN ’ s Sustainable Development Goals, blue carbon cannot be ignored. Have you read?What are blue carbon credits and how to maximise their impactMapping Blue Carbon Wealth Around the WorldWhy the future of carbon should be blueThe growing market for blue carbonDemand for blue carbon credits currently far outweighs supply and care must be taken to ensure that the growth of the growth of blue carbon is driven by principles and guidance that optimise outcomes for people, biodiversity and the climate. For this reason, Salesforce, the World Economic Forum ’ s Friends of Ocean Action, the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA), The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International, together with the Meridian Institute, have facilitated the creation of the High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles & Guidance. This framework, developed through an open and global consultative process, builds on and codifies existing best practices and provides a roadmap to maximise the potential of blue carbon. The international carbon market consists of carbon credits and offsets that represent avoided emissions or removed carbon — or its equivalent — from the atmosphere. The global carbon market is expanding rapidly and could grow to $50 – 100 billion by 2030, but has come under scrutiny due to poor project design and allegations of greenwashing. However, the climate crisis has reached such urgency that we need all available climate action simultaneously, including carbon credits, as a ‘last, but not later ’ investment. Companies and individuals can and should invest in high-quality carbon credits to help fulfill their net-zero ambitions. The climate crisis has reached such urgency that we need all available climate action simultaneously, including carbon credits as a ‘last, but not later ’ investment. Salesforce has outlined this important decision-making process in a recent blog underpinning its new Net Zero Marketplace. It has taken 20 years after the 1997 Kyoto Protocol kicked off the carbon market for the very first blue carbon credits to be issued — but now blue carbon is garnering the attention it deserves. Five principles for effective blue carbon Image: Meridian InstituteFive principles for effective blue carbonCompanies can play an important role in scaling the supply of high-quality blue carbon credits to help fulfil their net-zero and nature positive ambitions. With increased interest and investment in this market comes a timely opportunity for blue carbon stakeholders to align on a shared definition of high-quality blue carbon projects and credits and how to engage the market responsibly. The following five principles, each of equal importance, along with the subsequent guidance are foundational to the development and deployment of high-quality blue carbon projects and credits. 1. Safeguard nature.Blue carbon projects provide unique opportunities to preserve and enhance ecosystem resilience. Conversely, the destruction of blue carbon ecosystems often leads to a significant loss of biodiversity and the release of hundreds of years of emissions that had been sequestered under water. While market demand often prefers restoration, stakeholders should also prioritize the conservation of current ecosystems. 2. Empower people.Most blue carbon projects take place where people live and work. Blue carbon stakeholders must implement social safeguards to protect and enhance community member rights, knowledge and leadership and foster equitable access to the global carbon market. 3. Employ the best information, interventions and carbon accounting practices.The integrity of the voluntary carbon market hinges, in part, on the quality of information used to design projects and communicate the resulting carbon value of the credits generated. Purchasers, investors, suppliers, project developers and governments must use the most appropriate interventions and the best available scientific knowledge, including indigenous, traditional and local knowledge. DISCOVERWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about mangroves? Show more 4. Operate locally and contextually.Blue carbon ecosystems are incredibly heterogeneous with respect to their role in local customs, gender and power dynamics, resource use, management and ownership regimes and social, policy and governance structures. Project design should account for the social and ecological context as well as the local implications of international policies. 5. Mobilise high-integrity capital.High-quality blue carbon requires fair and transparent pricing and compensation that supports sustainable financing. Buyers should set science-based targets for limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5°C and compensate for any remaining emissions with high-quality carbon credits. One example of a high-quality blue carbon project is an innovative mangrove project in Cispata, Columbia, led by Conservation International and local NGOs with funding from Apple. The “Vida Manglar” project was the first blue carbon project to enter the international carbon market with its carbon fully calculated. The “Vida Manglar” project was the first to calculate how much carbon was stored in this Cispata mangrove forest. Image: Conservation InternationalThe future of blue carbonBlue carbon holds immense potential not only for decarbonization efforts, but also because of the wealth of co-benefits to communities and ecosystems. For example, mangroves support fish and other biodiversity which in turn support livelihoods and tourism, and provide coastal defences against floods. As carbon markets become bluer, the world must design and invest in blue carbon projects and credits that cause a shift towards greater accountability, equity and transparency. The High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles & Guidance is one resource that can help blue carbon stakeholders engage the market with integrity. Implementing and learning from these principles and guidance will unleash the full potential of blue carbon, cutting emissions while protecting some of the earth ’ s most unique and valuable ecosystems — and the people that rely on them.

4,"Saltmarsh ecosystems are protecting more than 88,000 homes from storm surges and are sequestering carbon at a rapid rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The data was released as part of the federal government's National Ocean Ecosystem Account, which showed the marshes sequestered about 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2021. In the past saltmarshes and mangrove swamps have been viewed as wastelands with little economic value. But their ability to absorb eight times as much carbon at 35 times the rate of ""land-based"" forests, according to Local Land Services (LLS), is one of the factors driving the effort to save them. The agency is working with farmers to fence off saltmarshes on private land. Fences up Shoalhaven dairy farmer Paul Anderson says he enjoys having a mix of wetlands and productive pastures on his Pyree property. ""This place here is about 200 acres … probably about 80 acres of it is saltmarsh,"" he said. ""The saltmarsh is pretty low country and you can't make any feed or silage off it, so it's just a holding paddock for cows. ""If we can beautify it a bit more, that's good — because we do have a bit of a wetland area with a few birds there and water all the time."" Mr Anderson and his brother Keith are working with LLS to fence off 17 hectares. About 80 per cent of the area is saltmarsh. The remaining 20 per cent is made up of mangroves and swamp oak forest. LLS senior land services officer Sonia Bazzacco said there was funding available to help farmers fence off key saltmarsh areas. ""This is a really large significant area that the Andersons are putting aside towards having an environmental gain,"" she said. ""I've been approaching a lot of farmers in Pyree, because there's actually 220 hectares of saltmarsh in the Shoalhaven. ""That's the largest area of saltmarsh in the whole of south-east New South Wales."" Key habitats Threats to coastal salt marsh include development, uncontrolled livestock, the rising sea level and mangrove incursion. ""The first step really is to exclude stock off these very sensitive areas,"" Ms Bazzacco said. Saltmarshes are a key breeding habitat for fish, birds and crustaceans. It has been estimated that mangrove-related species in eastern Australia account for about 67 per cent of the entire commercial catch. Recently saltmarshes and mangroves have attracted more funding for restoration work as countries around the world look to invest in a blue carbon strategy. ""A lot of people don't realise is that coastal saltmarsh is able to absorb eight times as much carbon [at] 35 times the rate than a land-based forest,"" Ms Bezzacco said. ""It's also very important in improving water quality. ""The saltmarsh acts as a buffer between the terrestrial and aquatic environment. ""Sediment and farm run-off, such as nitrogen and contaminants, are actually filtered through and absorbed and recycled by the saltmarsh."" Earlier this year the Albanese government invested $9.5 million to support five new practical restoration blue carbon projects. Environment and Water Minister Tanya Plibersek said in a statement that saltmarshes also protected homes. ""Over 19,000 kilometres of our coastline are being protected from storm surge by mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystems,"" she said. ""If these were lost it would cost over $225 billion to replace their coastal protection services with seawalls. ""This new data clearly shows how important they are and how many of us living along the coast of Australia benefit [from their protection], possibly without even realising.""

5,"Adnoc will use drone technology to plant 2.5 million mangrove seedlings in Abu Dhabi over the next three years as part of a contract signed with Distant Imagery, a UAE environmental technology company. The contract, announced at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, is part of the Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative and Adnoc's existing partnership with the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi, the state energy company said in a statement on Wednesday. Adnoc will use drones that can disperse more than 2,000 mangrove seeds in about eight minutes, as the company targets planting up to 10 million mangrove trees in Abu Dhabi by 2030. Mangroves can provide a living defence against the impact of climate change, by preventing erosion, stabilising Abu Dhabis coastlines and enhancing biodiversity, as well as significantly contributing to the quality of life in the area for future generations,"" said Ibrahim Al Zubi, senior vice president of sustainability and climate at Adnoc. Last week, the agency said drones had dispersed one million mangrove seeds in Abu Dhabi as a part of the first phase of the emirate's drone mangrove plantation project. The dispersal was carried out over several days at locations around Al Mirfa in Al Dhafra region. The planting programme is part of the UAEs initiative to add 100 million mangrove trees by 2030 a pledge made at the Cop26 climate change conference in November 2021. The UAE is home to more than a dozen mangrove sites and plans to expand and develop their presence across the country. Abu Dhabi aims to establish the emirate as a hub for research and innovation to support the conservation of mangroves, and focus on their importance for carbon sequestration to combat climate change. According to the agency's estimates, mangrove seeds dropped by drones will have a 48 per cent success rate which means 48 per cent of the seeds are expected to take root and grow into trees. As part of the first phase of Adnoc's programme, custom-built drones and rigging equipment built by Distant Imagery and supported by the agency were used to plant more than 200,000 mangrove seeds in Abu Dhabis Mirfa coastal lagoon. The germination and growth of the mangroves will be monitored for the next year, the company said. Adnoc's initiative to aerially plant 2.5 million mangroves will include a volunteer programme, with opportunities to participate in each stage of the planting process, from picking seeds to helping monitor the growth of the mangroves. ""We are looking forward to working with Adnoc on this mangrove project to ensure that we all achieve our objectives of combating climate change through nature-based solutions as mangroves are very resilient and are hugely important thanks to their qualities as effective carbon sinks,"" said Ahmed Alhashmi, executive director of terrestrial and marine biodiversity at the agency. Adnoc said this month that it would invest $15 billion in decarbonisation projects by 2030, including clean power, carbon capture and storage, further electrification of operations, energy efficiency and new measures to build on its policy of zero routine gas flaring. The company has been restoring mangrove ecosystems for more than a decade and has planted approximately two million mangrove seedlings at its operational sites and across Abu Dhabi, it said. Adnoc is ""committed to leveraging nature-based solutions as integral, ready and cost-effective offsets in support of climate change adaptation, mitigation and resilience, balancing energy systems and blue carbon ecosystems"", the statement added.

6,"ABU DHABI, 18th January, 2023 (WAM) -- Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) today announced it has signed a contract with Distant Imagery, a UAE-based environmental technology company, to plant 2.5 million mangrove seedlings across Abu Dhabi using innovative drone planting technology adopted by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD). The new contract signed at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) comes within the framework of the Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative and the existing partnership with EAD. It enables ADNOC to accelerate its mangrove planting activities by deploying drones that can disperse over 2,000 mangrove seeds in roughly eight minutes, reinforcing the company's commitment to plant up to 10 million mangroves in Abu Dhabi by 2030. Ibrahim N. Al Zu'bi, Senior Vice President of Sustainability & Climate at ADNOC, said, ""Through our Net Zero by 2050 ambition, we are placing sustainability at the centre of our growth, and we are building on our proud legacy of environmental stewardship to create lasting and sustainable value for the UAE and its people. Mangroves can provide a living defence against the impact of climate change, by preventing erosion, stabilizing Abu Dhabi's coastlines and enhancing biodiversity, as well as significantly contributing to the quality of life in the area for future generations."" As part of the first phase of the programme, special custom-built drones and rigging equipment, built by Distant Imagery and supported by EAD, were used to plant more than 200,000 mangrove seeds in Abu Dhabi's Mirfa coastal lagoon. The germination and growth of the mangroves will be monitored for the next year; in parallel ADNOC will proceed with aerially planting a total of 2.5 million mangroves over three years. Ahmed Alhashmi, Executive Director of Terrestrial and Marine Biodiversity Sector at EAD, commented, ""This ADNOC-driven project of planting 2.5 million mangrove seedlings in different areas across Abu Dhabi will contribute greatly to the larger emirate-wide Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative, as well as to Abu Dhabi's contribution to the UAE's national goal of planting 100 million mangroves by 2030. ADNOC has always been a longstanding and significant partner to us at EAD, and its efforts in ensuring our national goals are met are crucial. We are looking forward to working with ADNOC on this mangrove project to ensure that we all achieve our objectives of combatting climate change through nature-based solutions as mangroves are very resilient and are hugely important thanks to their qualities as effective carbon sinks."" An extensive volunteer programme will be part of ADNOC's mangrove planting initiative, with opportunities for volunteers to participate in each point of the planting process, from picking seeds to helping monitor the growth of the mangroves. Jane Glavan, Co-Owner of Distant Imagery, said, ""Rehabilitating mangrove ecosystems is an effective way to mitigate the effects of climate change and restore natural habitats and biodiversity. At Distant Imagery, we are taking an ecological-restoration approach to the mangrove planting, from site selection to planting patterns, and we are honored to be involved in such an impactful project that supports ADNOC's Net Zero by 2050 ambition and promotes Abu Dhabi's natural ecosystem."" ADNOC is committed to leveraging nature-based solutions as integral, ready and cost-effective offsets in support of climate change adaptation, mitigation and resilience, balancing energy systems and blue carbon ecosystems. In collaboration with the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi, ADNOC has been restoring mangrove ecosystems for over a decade and has planted approximately 2 million mangrove seedlings at its operational sites and accross Abu Dhabi, helping to restore these natural carbon sinks. These efforts support the UAE's aim to plant 100 million mangroves by 2030, as well as the United Nations conventions on conserving biodiversity.

7,"To collaborate with the conservation of Panama's mangroves, National Audubon Society and Panama Audubon Society have created an alliance since last year to value, protect and improve the coastal natural capital of Panama Bay and Parita Bay with funds from the government of the United Kingdom, administered through the Natural Capital Laboratory of the Inter-American Development Bank, with support from the Ministry of Environment and the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Panama. This project has as part of its priority interest the conservation of mangrove ecosystems, the establishment of a blue carbon baseline, the knowledge and dissemination of the importance of these two components and the strengthening of public policies that promote the conservation and restoration of mangroves, so they will continue to strengthen this alliance to make these benefits effective. The Panama Audubon Society reiterated that mangroves contribute to food security, filter the waters that flow into the oceans and reef systems and protect coastal communities around the world from storm surges, tsunamis, sea level rise and erosion, therefore, their conservation is a priority. ""The fish and crustaceans that grow in mangroves are sources of income for adjacent populations and have become an effective weapon in combating climate change thanks to the tons of carbon they capture. Teaching schools and the general public about the multiple benefits of mangroves allows us to continue adding allies that act in their protection and conservation,"" said Rosabel Miró, Executive Director of Audubon Panama. Meanwhile, Julio Montes de Oca, of the National Audubon Society, said that mangroves are our first line of defense against climate change. ""Because of the coastal protection they provide and the services they provide to communities, we must redouble our efforts to conserve and restore them,"" said Montes. The call for mangrove conservation by both organizations comes in the framework of the celebrations of the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, which was celebrated last July 26. To complement these actions, this Thursday, July 28, a virtual regional meeting will be held under the title 'Blue Carbon and Mangrove Conservation: Experiences from Panama and Colombia'.

Through the partnership, Apple says AERF will enter into conservation agreements with local community members, offering support in exchange for conserving and protecting the mangroves on their land. The ultimate goal of the partnership is to help transition the local economy to one that relies on keeping mangroves intact and healthy. Through the new partnership, AERF will also engage Conservation International to verify the climate benefits of the mangroves, accounting for the carbon sequestered in both the trees and soil. In addition to protecting coastal communities from climate impacts like the unpredictable monsoons and rising tides that threaten the Raigad district, mangroves act as carbon sinks that absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their soil, plants, and other sediment. Dr. Archana Godbole, director of AERF said ""Though mangrove conservation issues are diverse and different in each place, here in our project area, opportunities are also many. Training our young, enthusiastic team as well as local communities for blue carbon will surely help us travel a long way to achieve mangrove conservation in this vibrant coastal area along the Arabian Sea."" Blue Carbon is generated by healthy mangrove ecosystems that can store more carbon in their soil, more than land-based forests. AERF will also apply learnings from Conservation International's pilot blue carbon project in Cispatá, Colombia, launched in 2018 to their work in Raigad, with plans to establish a model that can be scaled across India. In addition to protecting the existing mangroves in the area, Apple's grant supports the restoration of mangroves across a 50-hectare area where they have degraded, as well as the purchase and distribution of portable bio-stoves that allow people to cook without cutting down mangroves for firewood.

9,"Scientists with Australias Deakin University Blue Carbon Lab are kicking off a trial with biodegradable structures that could enhance the growth and survival of coastal wetland species like mangroves and sea grass as part of restoration work in Pork Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay. The structures, made from potato starch, provide seedlings with protection from high-energy environments without limiting their growth. They break down over time, making way for the established plants to thrive. Coastal wetlands, such as mangrove forests and saltmarshes, provide many benefits including protection from storm surges, and habitat for coastal wildlife. They also store atmospheric carbon, acting as a nature-based solution against climate change. However, coastal wetlands have been degraded and lost around the world and restoring them can be challenging. Dr Stacey Trevathan-Tackett of Deakin Universitys Blue Carbon Lab says that restoration efforts can be hampered by harsh environmental conditions that damage wetland plants at crucial early stages of their growth making it important to constantly develop new methods to encourage growth. We are exploring new ways to help improve the success of restoration and recovery of wetlands, Dr Trevathan-Tackett said in a press release. This includes trialling new and creative techniques in different habitats and conditions, as well as working with local communities along the way. While mangrove seeds planted into these structures over the summer have started to sprout, researchers want to quantify survival and growth over time and determine how the novel approach is working and to make improvements along the way. The project, titled Regenerating Our Coasts, is a three-year programme partnered with Beach Energy that focuses on research and outreach. Beachs CEO Morn Engelbrecht said: Beach Energy is proud to partner with Deakin Unis Blue Carbon Lab to support research to help restore blue carbon ecosystems and accelerate coastal restoration. This is Beachs largest ever environmental partnership and demonstrates our commitment to leaving a positive contribution to communities. With the Regenerating Our Coasts programme, we are excited to see seedlings beginning to grow through the structures, said Dr Trevathan-Tackett. But they have a long way to go, and so do we in terms of trialling different approaches to maximise what this method can do. Not all coastal wetlands are the same, different environmental conditions, historical impacts, and even the types of plants and animals present influence the restoration success. With such diversity at play, the Blue Carbon Lab team aim to optimise these structures across different wetlands and plant species in Victorias Port Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay. The trial site in Western Port has enlisted the help of citizen scientists, who will measure both the survival and growth of a batch of mangrove seedlings. The data collected as part of ongoing monitoring will help the researchers further develop restoration approaches at local mangrove sites. We see outreach as a vital part of the project, said Dr Trevathan-Tackett. Engaging with communities through education and knowledge-exchange means that more people understand the problem and support what were doing to solve it. In turn, by getting involved in citizen science activities, they are contributing to research projects that will ultimately benefit restoration efforts, Dr Trevathan-Tackett concluded.

10," Joint media release with Pat Conroy, Minister for International Development and the Pacific.  The Australian Government and CSIRO will commence a partnership with Google to combine world-leading artificial intelligence and digital science with cutting-edge climate science to respond to the climate change crisis in the Indo-Pacific.  In collaboration with Australias development program in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, CSIRO has partnered with Google to better understand and utilise blue carbon ecosystems in Indo-Pacific and Australian coastlines.  Blue carbon refers to natural carbon sinks, which can play a role in mitigating the increase of greenhouse gases caused by human activity.  The research will investigate new ways to accurately monitor, map and report on seagrass and associated biodiversity indicators.  Field work has started in in Fijis Lau Islands and Labuan Bajo in Indonesia.  Minister for Industry and Science, Ed Husic, said the collaboration is a great example of CSIROs work with industry to support the capacity of Australia and our region to respond to climate change.  In many countries, the most vulnerable communities rely on coastal ecosystems for their livelihoods and resilience, Minister Husic said.  Australian, Fijian and Indonesian researchers will work together to develop sophisticated techniques for gathering data about biodiversity and habitats.  The information can then be used to inform national policies and climate change action.  Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said Australia recognised the importance of protecting biodiversity to mitigate and build resilience to climate change.  Mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass are blue carbon ecosystems, which provide long-term carbon storage, Minister Conroy said.  They are also among the most extensive and valuable coastal ecosystems across the Indo-Pacific, providing benefits directly linked to sustainable livelihoods, and climate resilience and adaptation.  This collaboration highlights the Australian Governments commitment to working with our Indo-Pacific partners on important issues, including climate change.  CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Larry Marshall said the initiative will support climate-smart decisions that strengthen climate resilience and economic growth.  The combination of Googles world-leading AI and platform technology, CSIROs deep climate, digital and AI expertise, DFATs experience delivering high-quality development programs, and skills of our in-country partners, will help create tailored and cutting-edge solutions for Australia and the Indo-Pacific, Dr Marshall said.  Mel Silva, Managing Director, Google Australia and New Zealand, said that the partnership had been made possible by the Digital Future Initiative.  The Digital Future Initiative is an investment in the extraordinary talent and creativity of Australians and will allow us to continue working with CSIRO to harness machine learning tools to protect marine fauna and endangered species, and the future of our nations coastline, Ms Silva said.  Our shared goal is to support long-term climate resilience and improve access to technology for developing nations in the Indo-Pacific region.  This partnership will be delivered through Australias Science and Technology for Climate Partnership (SciTech4Climate) program. It is a $2.7 million investment through DFAT and Googles Digital Future Initiative, including in-kind and funding contributions.  BACKGROUND on blue carbon: In August, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek released the first National Ocean Ecosystem Account, which collects information on carbon storage and coastal protection benefits of Australias mangroves and seagrass, known as blue carbon ecosystems.  In June, the Government announced increased support for blue carbon ecosystems by investing $9.5 million to support five new practical restoration projects and endorsed the Joint Declaration on the Creation of a Global Coalition for Blue Carbon.

11,"TORONTO, Nov. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Base Carbon Inc. (NEO: BCBN) (OTCQX: BCBNF) (""Base Carbon"", or the ""Company""), has entered a letter of intent (“LOI”) with the Danish Red Cross to scope and assess “Blue Carbon” reduction projects in Southeast Asia. Highlights: Base Carbon signs Letter of Intent with Danish Red Cross to develop blue carbon projects in Southeast Asia Scope includes mangrove projects in Southeast Asia, an initial project in Philippines is in the scoping phase Additional members of the Red Cross Movement are anticipated to be involved in the partnership, with potential to expand Terms of the agreement include a 24-month term  83% of the global carbon cycle is circulated through the ocean and coastal habitats cover less than 2% of the total ocean area accounting for 50% of the total carbon sequestered in ocean sediments Base Carbon Inc., through its subsidiary Base Carbon Capital Partners Corp, has entered into a letter of intent with the Danish Red Cross to scope and assess — and potentially develop — one or more mangrove-related carbon reduction projects in Southeast Asia which are anticipated to follow VERRA “Tidal Wetland and Seagrass”, methodology. The parties have committed to work together until at least October 2024 with respect to such potential projects in the region. The Danish Red Cross are recognized innovators in designing investment and underwriting structures related to the commercialization of carbon, climate and social benefit projects. Potential projects related to the prospective partnership will be jointly funded by the Danish Red Cross including other Red Cross affiliated entities. The parties anticipate that any project will be insured by Dunant Re IC Limited, an insurance company established by the Danish Red Cross and Replexus. The Company anticipates providing regular updates as the parties work together. “This partnership is consistent with Base Carbon’s mandate to work with leading organizations on carbon projects with strong economics and social benefit additionalities. The Red Cross Movement, with its scale and breadth is ideally suited to execute carbon reduction and removal projects. Base will invest and contribute technology to materialize these projects,” stated Philip Hardwick, COO of Base Carbon. Blue Carbon and Mangrove Carbon Projects Blue carbon refers to the carbon captured by ocean and coastal habitats such as seagrass meadows, whale habitats and mangroves, which act as robust sinks by sequestering and storing large amounts of carbon in both the plants and sediments below. By the numbers, 83% of the global carbon cycle is circulated through the ocean and coastal habitats cover less than 2% of the total ocean area — but account for 50% of the total carbon sequestered in ocean sediments. By comparison, these habitats store two to four times more carbon than terrestrial forests making them a key component of nature-based solutions to climate change and effecting in helping corporations achieve their net zero commitments. In addition to acting as powerful carbon sequestration properties, mangrove projects mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, prevent erosion, and help reestablish fish and other marine life habitats. In addition to acting as natural carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) agents, mangroves also serve as a natural barrier against the effects of hurricanes and as habitats for species that are crucial to the ecological and economic health of coastal communities. Despite their numerous benefits, these ecosystems are experiencing rapid degradation from anthropogenic activities and climate change at a worrying rate, transforming their impressive capture capabilities into climate liabilities: When mangrove forests are cleared and destroyed, they release massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon Sequestration and Socio-Economic Benefits of the Projects Beyond carbon storage benefits, ecological restoration projects improve ecosystem services and enhance biodiversity increase. These initiatives benefit local communities' climate resilience, improve soil for stronger food systems and help restore microbial relationships to protect human health. Southeast Asia has one of the largest and most diverse mangroves habitats, but its continuing deforestation and degradation of natural forest areas is creating a complex situation with both local and global ramifications. The Red Cross will help implement social development programs for improving the quality of life of coastal communities, who will be involved in all stages of the projects and will be trained to carry out the restoration work. The Red Cross will help ensure the long-term sustainability of these social impacts by promoting the interrelated aspects that mangroves can bring to local communities: source of income and food for local populations, breeding grounds to support fisheries, protection from natural calamities, improvement of the water quality, promotion of ethical tourism, etc. During a recent due diligence visit, Base Carbon members engaged in consultation meetings with local people and evaluated the condition of the damaged mangroves within the project's targeted area. About Base Carbon Base Carbon, through Base Carbon Capital Partners Corp., provides capital, development expertise and management operating resources to projects involved primarily in voluntary carbon markets and the broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) economy.

12," New Delhi, Oct 28 (IANS) Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels today are higher than at any point in the past 800,000 years. As a result of global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions, many countries have seen record extreme temperatures, more frequent wildfires, and destructive floods. This has resulted in devastating impacts upon the people and the nature.   The ocean is experiencing increased temperature, acidification, and oxygen depletion. Marine ecosystems have experienced significant, and increasing disruption as the impacts of climate change, multiplied by other human impacts – notably industrial fishing – have applied huge pressure on life below water.  When coastal wetlands are damaged or degraded they capture less carbon and release significant amounts of greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that might have been stored for thousands of years.  Blue carbon ecosystems are some of the world's most efficient absorbers of CO2 and long-term carbon sinks. The carbon sequestered by the world's oceans and coastal wetlands is termed as blue carbon.   To date, research has focused on the blue carbon capacity of three coastal wetland habitats: mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes. These habitats are currently the only marine habitats that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides guidance to countries for inclusion in their national greenhouse gas inventories.  Other emerging blue carbon components of interest include seaweed, especially kelp and Sargassum, phytoplankton, shellfish beds, seabed sediments and marine vertebrates, like sharks, whales and deepwater 'mesopelagic' fish. For want of detailed research, these are yet to be included in international climate policies or carbon financing mechanisms, but are known to be important components of carbon sequestration to seabed sediments and the deep ocean.  Mangrove forests are highly productive and sequester more carbon per unit area than any other tropical ecosystem, land or sea.  Mangroves protect a global carbon stock of 2.6 – 10.4 billion tonnes, of which 80per cent is stored in the soil.  Globally, mangroves sequester up to 34 million tonnes of carbon per annum, equivalent to one year's CO2 emissions from 31 coal fired power plants.  More than 30 per cent of the world's mangroves have been destroyed since 1960 and losses continue at a rate of 0.11 per cent per year, releasing greenhouse gases that account for up to 10 per cent of deforestation emissions globally.  Healthy mangroves are important defences against storms and sea level rise and sustain coastal fisheries through their nursery function to fish and shellfish.  Mangroves are salt-tolerant forests that grow at the interface between land and sea in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes across over 118 countries. In 2012, global mangrove cover was estimated at 14.5 million hectares, nearly the same size as Bangladesh, most of which was in Asia (42 per cent).  The present study collated data on the Indian blue carbon repository (mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes) from peer-reviewed literature on carbon stock assessment. This meta-analysis indicated that the blue carbon ecosystems of India could have a collective carbon stock of 67.35 Tg C (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marsh accounting for 67 Tg C, 0.0630 Tg C, and 0.0049 Tg C, respectively). Several studies have ubiquitously measured the spatial extent of mangroves (4991 km2) and seagrasses (517 km2) in India; however, the salt marshes (290–1398 km2) have contradictions in estimates.  The green payments against the blue carbon ecosystems of India can be as high as $9.6 billion, whereas the social cost of carbon sequestered by these ecosystems can vary between $0.47 billion and 5.43 billion.  India's Sundarbans is among five sites that have the highest blue carbon stocks globally, according to a new assessment of greenhouse gas volumes emitted from and absorbed by forests in Unesco World Heritage sites.  --IANS  san/arm  Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Wire Subject: GREENHOUSE GASES (99%); COASTAL AREAS (91%); WETLANDS (91%); BLUE ECONOMY (90%); CARBON CAPTURE & STORAGE (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); ECOSYSTEMS & HABITATS (90%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); MARINE BIOLOGY (90%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); SEAWEED & ALGAE (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); OCEANS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICY (78%); NITROGEN OXIDES (78%); WEATHER (78%); ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (77%); DEFORESTATION (77%); EXTREME TEMPERATURES (77%); MARINE MAMMALS (77%); SEA LEVEL CHANGES (77%); WILDFIRES (77%); FISHES (76%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (76%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (74%); FIRES (72%); FLOODS & FLOODING (72%); COMMERCIAL FISHING (70%); WETLANDS CONSERVATION (69%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS CONSERVATION (66%) Industry: BLUE ECONOMY (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); METHANE (78%); DEFORESTATION (77%); ENERGY & UTILITIES (77%); NATURAL GAS (77%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (76%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (74%); COMMERCIAL FISHING (70%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS CONSERVATION (66%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (60%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (60%) Geographic: NEW DELHI, INDIA (89%); EARTH (79%); ASIA (79%)"
13,"- The Bahamas has announced plans to sell $300m in blue carbon credits in 2022 - Coastal ecosystems like mangrove forests can store large quantities of carbon - Firms in Colombia and Japan have sought to utilise blue carbon credits - Countries are leveraging their natural environments to fund environmental projects The Bahamas has become the latest emerging market to seek to leverage its natural environs to fund projects to protect its environment, announcing plans to sell blue carbon credits before the end of the year. In late April the government unveiled plans that would give companies the opportunity to purchase the credits to offset their own carbon emissions. The proposed deal is based on the Bahamas' estimated 4270 sq km of mangrove forests, seagrass beds and other ecosystems that absorb and store significant amounts of carbon. Upon announcing the initiative, Prime Minister Philip Davis said the Bahamas aimed to raise $300m to invest in efforts to maintain the country's marine environment, as well as other renewable energy and green projects. The nation has pledged to generate at least 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, and is partnering with international institutions like the EU and the Inter-American Development Bank to roll out solar energy projects. The importance of blue carbon While green carbon credit projects that involve forests and grasslands are well established in global financial markets, the sale of blue carbon credits is still at an early stage. However, there are some signs that this may be beginning to change. This shift comes as governments and companies alike are becoming more aware of the environmental potential of maritime ecosystems in combatting climate change. Coastal ecosystems like mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows have substantial carbon storage potential: not only can they store up to 10 times more carbon than land forests, but they can also hold carbon for 10 times longer than tropical forests. Another initiative based on blue carbon credits is the Cispatá conservation project, located on Colombia's Caribbean coast. A collaboration between Colombia's Marine and Coastal Research Institute, Conservation International and Apple, the project aims to conserve and restore 11,000 ha of mangrove forest. Those involved say the project will remove an estimated 1m tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere over the course of its lifetime. It is hoped that blue carbon credit sales will help to cover half of the project's $600,000 in operating costs. Meanwhile, in Japan, power company Electric Power Development, better known as J-POWER, has begun generating its own blue carbon credits by raising algae and a seagrass bed near its Kitakyushu plant. The company does not plan to sell the credits but rather use them to offset carbon emissions from its power plants. By establishing seagrass beds around the country, J-POWER expects to absorb 100 tonnes of carbon per year. There are a number of other blue carbon conservation projects taking place in emerging markets around the world, including Kenya, Senegal, Madagascar, India and Pakistan, the last of which is home to the world's largest mangrove restoration project, spanning an estimated 350,000 ha. Environment-linked financing in emerging markets The expansion of blue carbon conservation and credit projects is another example of how emerging markets are increasingly looking to find innovative ways to fund environmental projects. For example, in September last year the government of Belize launched a debt-for-nature swap to restructure its sole sovereign bond. Under the terms of the deal, Belize bought back its debt at a significant discount - $0.55 cents for every $1 - in exchange for increasing efforts to protect its marine environment. Meanwhile, earlier this year the World Bank issued the world's first wildlife conservation bond, raising money to protect endangered black rhino populations in South Africa. The five-year, $150m ""rhino bond"" is an outcome-based financial instrument tied to the rate of population growth of black rhinos in South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park and Great Fish River Nature Reserve, meaning that investors will receive a ""success payment"" if the population increases. In a similar vein, Chile became the first country to issue bonds tied specifically to sustainability goals when it sold $2bn in US dollar-denominated sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) in March. In contrast to other types of green bonds that raise money to fund environmentally friendly developments such as solar and wind power projects, SLBs incentivise climate-positive solutions by incorporating environmental objectives, along with a series of penalties for issuers if they fail to meet their goals. In Chile's case, the bond stipulates that the country may emit no more than 95 tonnes of CO2 and equivalent by 2030, and that 60% of its electricity production should come from renewable sources by 2032. Given the increasing focus on environmental, social and governance metrics in both the public and private sectors, the development of environment-based financing initiatives could set a precedent for emerging markets looking to raise funds in the future.

14,"Editor’s Note  Shenzhen Daily has partnered with Professor Matteo Convertino to present a monthly column titled “EcoBites.”   It will shed light on ecological unknowns, mysteries, needs and efforts in response to urgent biodiversity and climate issues, as well as broader sustainability goals where Shenzhen might serve as a role model for other cities.  In this column, Convertino will cover such ecological topics as blue carbon ecosystems, algal blooms, and coral seas through written articles and photos.  Convertino works as an associate professor at the Institute of Environment and Ecology of Tsinghua University, Shenzhen International Graduate School and is the principal investigator (PI) of the school’s Future Ecosystem Lab (TREES).  WALKING along the coastline is a favorite pastime for many in this city — the fragrance of the sea, the sunrise and sunset and the breeze are a few of the infinite things to enjoy. But something unnerving is happening; where are our coasts going?  The bad news for humankind is that both oceans and coasts are under pressure, amid atmospheric and marine warming, habitat destruction, pollution, and the impacts of overfishing and industrial activity. These destructive factors are undermining the roles that marine and riverine ecosystems play in slowing down climate change.  With a projected sea-level rise of 0.5-2.0 meters by 2100 driven by a 4 degrees Celsius rise in temperatures, there is the risk of forced displacement of up to 200 million people (3% of the global population). The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), home to 80 million, is one of the most vulnerable regions on the planet.  The bleak prospects are exacerbated by the subsidence of reclaimed land and destroyed coastal ecosystems.  Certain coastal ecosystems are called “blue carbon ecosystems.” Tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows act as deep carbon reservoirs and sequester greenhouse gases with the highest efficiency among all types of ecosystems.  Is there a way to rewind the already tickling clock of ecological decay? I believe the answer is positive, but it must be done with precision and requires a close collaboration of the academia, governments and industries.  Futian Mangrove Reserve is a perfect example of a healthy blue carbon ecosystem, where tidal flats and mangroves are supplied with freshwater inflow from the Shenzhen River and other canals — an essential condition for the optimal function and survival of these ecosystems.  An interesting thing noted in the local coastal ecosystems is an increase in carbon sequestration despite the decreasing coverage of vegetation, which can partly be explained by overstimulation of plants in relation to night-time illumination, higher air temperatures and density of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet it remains to be seen for how long this trend is durable and whether we are creating a “carbon time bomb” that would someday release all the sequestered carbon, in case mangroves disappear due to sea level rise or other factors.  Research by the TREES Lab at Tsinghua University, Shenzhen International Graduate School estimates that a tipping point will arrive in 2070, when GBA cities will be threatened by inundation due to sea level rise, if we do nothing about climate change.  Some years from now, we may have to adapt to the rising sea level and live in floating houses, alongside other species next to the mangroves.  One solution is tapping into the potential of blue carbon ecosystems by expanding mangrove forests and related habitats that are already in a suboptimal condition.  The healthy functioning of such an ecosystem depends on the equilibrium between species, proper water quantity and quality, and other environmental factors. Here are some aspects we can work on.  First, we can reconnect mangroves with other habitats via drainage networks to ensure they have the necessary freshwater inflow.  Second, keystone species for blue carbon habitats such as fish and crustaceans must be preserved for biodiversity balance and ecological functions. For example, crabs provide necessary aeration to mangroves roots, which facilitates carbon sequestration.  Third, the maximum load of nutrients must be identified and strictly followed for the healthy function of blue carbon vegetation.  Fourth, we need to keep a close watch on ecosystems for any warning signs.  Finally, everyone has a share in this cause and needs to bear in their mind that acting responsibly benefits not just nature but also humankind.  With these steps, we can leverage climate risks as opportunities to expand blue carbon habitats for the carbon neutrality goal and climate regulation.

15,"Off the Caribbean coast of Colombia, rare manatee calves have been spotted in the canals and rivers of Cispat Bay's mangrove forests. The once-critically endangered American crocodile is now seen more frequently. Birds and lizards nest in the branches, fish and shrimps use the roots as nurseries. These 11,000 protected hectares (27,000 acres) of mangroves are a biodiversity hotspot. But the Cispat conservation project, a collaboration between Colombia's Marine and Coastal Research Institute (Invemar), Conservation International (CI) and Apple, is not just of interest to birdwatchers and ecologists. It has attracted the attention of marine scientists, researchers and corporations, as it is among the first to measure and sell a new type of credit to fund conservation: ""blue carbon"". Mangroves, like other coastal wetlands, are powerful carbon sinks. That is, they suck up carbon dioxide from the air to store in their roots and branches, as well as the sediment that collects around them. They do this so well that they can store up to 10 times more carbon than forests. And unlike ""green carbon"" rainforests, which store carbon in biomass, and therefore release it when the trees die, mangroves store most of the carbon in their soil and sediment. If undisturbed, it stays there for millennia. This superpower means ""blue carbon"" (the sequestration and storage of carbon by ocean ecosystems) is gaining attention in the race towards net zero. And the ""big three"" stores of blue carbon - mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass - are suddenly urgent new areas of conservation. As much as a fifth of the emissions cuts we need to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C will need to come from the ocean, according to the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy. Protecting and restoring seagrass, mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems - which account for more than 50% of all carbon storage in ocean sediments - could help absorb the equivalent of as much as 1.4bn tons of emissions a year by 2050, it says. These ecosystems are some of the most threatened in the world by coastal development - damaged by farming, harmful fishing practices and pollution - so protecting and restoring them is expensive. Enter the carbon-offset market. Some conservation groups are selling carbon credits to fund their work. For example, Verra, a non-profit organisation based in the US that administers the world's leading carbon-credit standard, estimates that the carbon emissions mitigated by Cispat to be almost 1m tonnes over three decades - the equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions from the annual mileage of 214,000 cars. María Claudia Diazgranados, a marine biologist and CI's blue carbon director in Colombia, said: ""We have been looking for a way to fund this ecosystem for years. Some 50% of mangroves have been lost from the Caribbean coast over the past three decades, due to cattle ranching, roads and tourism."" The money from selling blue carbon credits will go directly to communities to fund the Cispat mangrove restoration. CI, which is also working with local partners and communities, hopes the credits will cover half of the project's $600,000 (£440,000) operating costs. ""The carbon market is not the goal, it's the cherry on top,"" says Diazgranados. The carbon-offset market remains controversial. Not all schemes are reliable. A Guardian investigation earlier this year found several carbon schemes paid for by logging firms were selling carbon credits based on keeping forests standing, thereby allowing other logging to continue.  However, for ocean scientists alarmed at the rate these ecosystems are disappearing, blue carbon could be used as leverage - to restore and conserve parts of the ocean that might not otherwise get much attention. Seagrass meadows, for example, which can store carbon in the seabed far more quickly than tropical forests - a remarkable 35 times faster and storing it for millennia rather than decades - are disappearing at a rate of 7% a year. The UK alone has lost 39% of its seagrass meadows since the 1980s. Meanwhile, more than 3,360 sq km of mangrove forests were lost between 2000 and 2016. At Cispat, communities are involved in both ""avoiding deforestation"", the more controversial element of the carbon-offset market, and restoration. The first stage - conserving mangroves - has already paid off: CI has persuaded farmers not to allow their water buffaloes to graze and damage the forests. The restoration stage will begin in a few months. ""It's easier to prove sequestration of carbon if you plant mangroves than to prove avoiding deforestation if the project didn't exist,"" Diazgranados admits. ""One thing we have learned is that if you want to do conservation you need to work with local communities. We have a day-to-day presence there, a strict monitoring project, site visits and satellite-image analysis to prove the mangrove area stays the same."" Dr Emily Pidgeon, vice-president for ocean science at CI, says Cispat has avoided the pitfalls of other carbon-offset schemes. ""We've learned a lot of lessons from what we have seen from terrestrial projects,"" Pidgeon says, insisting that the Cispat project has strict checks and balances, including a verified methodology to calculate the benefits to carbon emissions, communities and biodiversity. This includes regular site visits and techniques such as remote sensing. ""About 10 years ago we became aware of carbon stored in coastal wetlands and how, if you restore them, the carbon stores increase,"" she says. ""Back then, it was considered a harebrained scheme. But Cispat is the first blue carbon project to be verified by Verra and we have just sold our first blue carbon credits."" CI is already in talks with the Colombian government to expand its mangrove protection efforts to three other locations. Dan Crockett, a blue carbon specialist at the Blue Marine Foundation, an ocean conservation charity, says the demand for blue carbon investment has taken off over the past year. ""We've been approached by giant Norwegian shipping companies, renewable energy companies and finance companies looking for the opportunity to invest in blue carbon."" Two reasons lie behind the demand, he says: ""First, there is a global trend towards the need for nature-based solutions to the climate crisis. Second, there have been many breakthroughs in our understanding of oceans and the way they sequester and store carbon."" Blue carbon mangrove projects are in development or under way in Kenya, Senegal, Madagascar, Vietnam and the Sunderbans in India. Each aims to reduce emissions by hundreds of thousands of tonnes of CO 2 a year. By far the largest mangrove restoration project so far - nearly 25 times bigger than Cispat - is the Indus delta project, on the Arabian Sea in Pakistan. The Sindh regional government, working with the developer Indus Delta Capital, is planning to protect and restore mangroves over about 350,000 hectares.  Steve Crooks, of Silvestrum Climate Associates, a coastal geomorphologist who developed the methodology for the blue carbon finance scheme, says the Indus project aims to absorb the equivalent of 2m tonnes of CO 2 every year and to sell 1m credits in 2021, increasing to 30m credits over the next 10 years. Blue carbon is a triple win, he says. ""They are a hot commodity right now, mostly to big industry. It's a very promising time - for conservation financing, for restoration of these important ecosystems and to help these countries who are missing important targets.""

16,"Link to Image Link to Story A 2017 analysis by the World Resources Institute doubted the ability of Indonesia, the world's largest archipelagic state , to meets its target to reduce emissions by 29% by 2030. However, as a marine scientist, I strongly believe Indonesia's rich coastal ecosystems, comprising mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses, can help the country achieve this target. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses can capture carbon in both biomass and sediments. This capacity has been dubbed""blue carbon"", a term first coined in 2009 . Indonesia has around 31,894 square kilometres of mangroves and 30,000km² of seagrasses . These coastal ecosystems account for around 17% of the world's blue carbon reservoir . The global estimate of carbon storage capacity for all coastal wetlands is 20 petagrams of carbon (Pg C), which equals 20 gigatonnes (Gt) carbon. It is a huge resource that Indonesia can tap into. However, more research needs to be done to optimise these resources. How vegetated coastal ecosystems store carbonBlue carbon is one of the nature-based solutions that will not only save the planet's climate but also bring about benefits for the ocean itself. These shallow-water habitats provide essential spawning grounds, nursery grounds, feeding grounds and shelter for juveniles, as well as being home for many marine species. Similar to trees or forests on land, vegetated marine and coastal ecosystems also absorb carbon dioxide for their photosynthesis process. What makes them different is that the carbon stored in low-oxygen soil beneath will be preserved for millennia if left undisturbed. There is no fire threat underwater. Seagrass ecosystem in Kema, North Sulawesi. Blue Carbon Research Group-Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Although blue carbon ecosystems represent a much smaller area than terrestrial forests, their total contribution to long-term carbon sequestration is comparable to carbon sinks in terrestrial ecosytems. Studies have shown blue carbon ecosystems are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon dioxide than terrestrial ecosystems . They also store carbon in their biomass and sediment for about twice as effective as tropical forest . However, degradation of these ecosystems globally releases carbon back to the atmosphere. For example, eutrophication - excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems - driven by coastal development in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, caused the loss of 23km² of seagrass meadows from the 1960s to 1990s . This released 0.06-0.14 teragrams (equals to 0.14 megatonne) of CO₂ to the atmosphere over four decades. In Indonesia, it is estimated about one million hectares (ha) of mangroves have been lost since 1800 . Recent declines have mostly been due to causes such as clearing for unsustainable aquaculture and palm oil . Mitigating the worst Children participated in restorating 15,000ha of mangrove in Sorong, West Papua. Olha Mulalinda/Antara To ensure Indonesia's coastal ecosystem can function optimally to save the climate, a series of actions need to be carried out. This includes implementing effective policies. This has started with the government's low-carbon development initiative to ensure policies are in line with the emission reduction target in 2017. In addition, the National Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency targeted 600,000ha of mangrove forest restoration over the next four years. Indonesia has also started accounting for mangroves in its inventory of greenhouse gases . Yet it was only the above-ground part of this ecosystem that counted as carbon storage. Work is needed to provide more data for below-ground and soil mangrove carbon capture capacity. This depends on research collaborations. Research co-ordination between national institutions that are working in blue carbon assessment needs to be strengthened. Another issue that collaboration can resolve is a lack of data about seagrass blue carbon. Indonesia needs robust data for a national inventory of blue carbon to promote carbon storage and sequestration capacity of these ecosystems. Research collaboration, sustainable aquaculture and raising awareness of the importance of blue carbon are essential for Indonesia to reach the emission reduction target in 2030. Raising awareness of the importance of blue carbon ecosystems will also help conserve carbon in these ecosystems.

17,"PR Newswire Carbon Neutral Royalty Ltd. (""CNR"" or the ""Company"") (Private) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a carbon revenue stream agreement (the ""Investment Agreement"") with Worldview International Foundation and its related entities (collectively, ""Worldview""). The Investment Agreement covers projects undertaken by Worldview in pursuit of carbon credits. Worldview is one of the world's largest issuers of high-quality blue carbon credits and has foundations in the United States, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Gambia, and Myanmar. Worldview plans to establish new foundations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Kenya, Ghana and Oman in 2022 and 2023. Worldview has over 100,000 hectares of mangrove restoration projects under Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") with various governments and an additional 1,600 hectares for a seagrass restoration project. Worldview is targeting 500,000 hectares of mangrove restoration within ten years. PARTNERSHIP HIGHLIGHTS:Significant Exposure to Blue Carbon Credit Portfolio: Over 100,000 hectares of tropical wet, mangrove restoration areas with the potential to generate over 70 million Verified Carbon Units or VCUs to CNR's account over the life of the projects subject to the Investment Agreement.Premium Blue Carbon Segment: Blue Carbon has the highest effect on mitigation, as well as maintaining biodiversity and promoting the most diverse life-bearing ecosystems with significant co-benefits.High Margin Projects: Blue Carbon restoration projects are up to ten times more productive at sequestering carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests, and 1/3 the planting cost. Existing Worldview mangrove restoration projects have recently traded up to US$34/t.Significant Scalability: Worldview's global partnerships provides CNR exclusive right to a significant pipeline of mangrove restoration.Globally Recognized Project Developer: Worldview is a global leader in Blue Carbon Project Development. Worldview was founded in 1979 and has pioneered over 600 sustainable development projects in over 25 countries. Worldview was established and is led by Arne Fjortoft, former leader of the Norwegian opposition and a pioneer in wetland restoration. Worldview is advised by global leaders including the former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden and Former Minister of the Environment of Norway. Brett Heath, non-executive chairman of Carbon Neutral Royalty, commented ""I am thrilled that Worldview has chosen to partner with CNR as their preferred global finance partner in their critical mission to restore wetlands across the world. Arne is one of the great inspirational leaders of our time, pioneering ground-breaking mangrove restoration that have saved endangered species on the IUCN Red Lists through propagation, transformed biodiversity while combatting climate change to the benefit of thousands of people in local communities,"" Arne Fjortoft, founder of Worldview International Foundation commented ""On behalf of our highly motivated and competent staff, I am looking forward to expanding our capacity in partnership with CNR in support of the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. There is tremendous potential in natural climate solutions. CNR will contribute additional funding and competence to the development of these projects. Our partnership will provide urgently needed action with significant impact at this time of climate emergency."" TRANSACTION CNR expects to start planting in Gambia, Kenya and Myanmar this year, targeting 7,000 ha of planting by the end of 2023 for staged payments by CNR for up to US$13m. CNR will be entitled to 50% of the verified carbon credits generated over the life of the project. The remaining 50% will be for livelihoods and sustainable development of participatory communities. These benefits exclude the additional funding of community programs by CNR under the upfront investment cost, resulting in the communities being substantially the primary beneficiary in the projects. CNR is expected to receive Verified Carbon Units (or VCUs) under Verra's Verified Carbon Standard Program. Each VCU represents a reduction or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). CNR has also been granted a Right of First Investment to finance (a minimum of 50%) of Worldview's projects for a period of 5 years. BLUE CARBON Blue Carbon, captured by the world's oceans, represents more than 55% of the green carbon (captured by plants). The carbon captured by living organisms in oceans is stored in the form of sediments from mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses. It remains stored for millennia unlike other forestry which often stores for only decades. The ocean is the most effective carbon climate mitigator, circulating 83% of global carbon. Its algae production and mangrove shorelines are vital for its contribution to climate restoration and conservation. Mangrove restoration projects which have the highest effect on mitigation, as well as maintaining biodiversity and promoting life-bearing ecosystems, are ten times more productive at sequestering carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests and provide significant co-benefits. Mangroves tend to significantly improve biodiversity by providing a rich habitat for marine and bird nurseries. Fish stocks typically have increased by 50% where mangroves have been restored and directly responsible for the improvement of water quality. Mangroves can stabilize shorelines and guard against erosion, and vegetation cover typically leads to better soil conditions. Blue Carbon projects generate most substantial value for financing and carbon income with existing Worldview projects that have recently sold carbon credits at prices up to US$34/t. WORLDVIEW INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION Worldview is a global leader in Blue Carbon Project Development. Worldview has pioneered over 600 sustainable development projects in over 25 countries. Worldview specialises in blue carbon and has a globally renowned track record in mangrove restoration, conservation, and holds the world's largest mangrove seed bank. Worldview was founded in 1979 by Arne Fjortoft, a highly reputable conservationist and former leader of the Liberal party in Norway.

18,"PR Newswire Carbon Neutral Royalty Ltd. (""CNR"" or the ""Company""), a financing provider for high integrity carbon projects, is pleased to announce that Phase 1 planting of 1,500 hectares (""ha"") of mangrove forest at the Bokepyin project, situated on the Tanintharyi coastline of Myanmar, has been completed. CNR is financing this mangrove restoration project with Worldview International Foundation (""Worldview""). Myanmar's coastline extends for more than 2,000 km and contains a wide range of diverse coastal ecosystems, including mangroves. The Tanintharyi coastline hosts large areas of degraded mangrove forest with significant areas lost due to logging, charcoal production, agriculture and urban expansion. Mangroves are vital ecosystems which act as effective carbon sinks sequestering up to 10 times more carbon than mature tropical forests per hectare in their carbon-rich soils known as ""blue carbon"". Mangroves provide a wide range of co-benefits for biodiversity and local populations including water purification, coastal protection from storm surges and increased fish stocks. Worldview and CNR plan to restore 12,000 ha of mangrove restoration at the Bokepyin project, equivalent to planting an area twice the size of Manhattan. Without restoration initiatives, mangroves within the project area are unlikely to be able to recover. The combined density of newly planted mangroves is assessed to be approximately 2,500 per hectare, meaning there are now an estimated 3,750,000 mangroves growing within this Phase 1 planting area. Worldview has been investing considerably in local socio-economic development programmes to create community co-benefits to each restoration project aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. At the Bokeypin project, livelihood activities have been underway including upskilling the local communities for technical expertise related to seed collection, storage, and plantation. Phase 1 planting, which covered 1,500 Ha, has created over 400 jobs from the local communities. This included the collection of 5.3 million propagules from different species of mangrove. Direct seed sowing has been carried out at a spacing of 2 metres by 2 metres, with this spacing designed to promote maximum rates of long-term carbon sequestration. CNR recently commissioned an independent evaluation at the project as part of its ongoing programme monitoring, and reports received following site visits have been highly encouraging. Initial propagule survival rates have been 96.4% across 36 sample plots. Restoration has important implications for local biodiversity. At least six individuals of the globally 'critically endangered' mangrove Brugeria hainessii have been recorded in the area. Mammals categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (""IUCN"") as 'vulnerable' have been recorded including the Finless Porpoise, which is globally threatened, and saltwater crocodiles which are regionally rare. The Lesser Adjutant Stork, a globally 'vulnerable' species, has also been recorded. The Bokepyin project is currently undergoing registration for listing under Verra's Verified Carbon Standard Program and CNR has been informed by Worldview that this process is nearing completion. Further updates regarding mangrove restoration works at the project and its registration under Verra's Verified Carbon Standard Program will be made available by Worldview in due course.

19,"Dubai: Emirates News Agency has issued the following news release: As increased carbon emissions caused by destruction of ecosystems will further contribute to climate change, Abu Dhabi ’ s Blue Carbon Project is a promising initiative to prevent such a situation, according to a top official. 'One major programme we have worked on at the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) is the Blue Carbon Project. Blue Carbon refers to the ability of coastal vegetation to store carbon. Blue carbon ecosystems, which include mangrove forests, saltmarshes, and seagrass beds, store and sequester carbon in biomass and sediments,' said Dr Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of the EAD. 'If these ecosystems are destroyed, buried carbon can be released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change and ocean acidification. This means we should strive to always keep these ecosystems intact,' she added while addressing a virtual session at the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) on Monday. She stressed the importance of conservation of the environment and sequestering carbon to achieve sustainable development, and shared insights and examples of initiatives and projects undertaken by the EAD to help preserve mangroves to combat climate change. The UAE was one of the first countries to recognise the importance of coastal habitats, and mangrove restoration and conservation efforts have been implemented since the 1970s, the official pointed out. 'This country ’ s affinity to the sea led to the initiation of the Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon Demonstration Project in 2012, which was led by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI) together with the EAD and illustrated the full potential of coastal ecosystems in Abu Dhabi,' Al Dhaheri explained. The official noted that the success of the project prompted the initiation of Phase II, known as the National Blue Carbon Project in 2015, which extended the understanding and valuation aspects of coastal Blue Carbon ecosystem services, particularly in mangroves, in the Northern and Eastern regions of the UAE. She concluded: 'More recently, the UAE Mangroves Annual Carbon Sequestration trial study was completed to assess soil carbon sequestration rates of UAE mangroves. The study found that the mangroves of the UAE sequester carbon at a rate of 0.5 tonnes per hectare per year, in addition to the carbon stocks stored within mangrove tree biomass. These rates are far higher compared to terrestrial soils of arid regions and other reported mangrove soil carbon sequestration rates around the Arabian Peninsula.' Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) is a global platform for accelerating the world ’ s sustainable development. Since its inception in 2008, ADSW has focused on delivering action across three principles: Global Collaboration and Leadership, Economic Development, and Technology and Innovation. The platform brings together a unique fusion of policy makers, industry specialists, technology pioneers and the next generation of sustainability leaders.

20,"By Keita Furukawa* Although coastal areas account for only about 7% of the ocean, they are highly productive. Ecosystems in the area support half of the world's fish caught and supply 50% of animal protein and minerals to 400 million people of the world. The coastal ecosystems that support such productivity are unevenly distributed and are in danger of serious loss or degradation.[1] The East Asian seas are home to 4 million hectares of mangrove forests, 3 million hectares of seagrass beds, and other blue carbon ecosystems that are hotspots of productivity and biodiversity and are suffering from a very high rate of loss.[2] Japan is an island nation that stretches from the subarctic to subtropical zones. The cold currents from the north and warm currents from the south have led to the spread of diverse seagrass beds and seaweed communities, the productivity of which has supported the development of coastal areas. For example, in Tokyo Bay 400 years ago (Edo-era), the bay's waterfront was covered with tidal flats and eelgrass beds. A wide variety of fish and shellfish were harvested by towing nets with sailboats over the eelgrass beds. The cultivation of seaweed, brown algae (nori), also flourished, and a superimposition of the eelgrass beds shown on a Edo-era's fishing grounds map and seaweed cultivation area shown on a 1960s map reveals that the Tokyo Bay coastline was covered by a continual green belt. Based on the high productivity of the sea and the diversity of its inhabitants, a rich food culture and a sustainable society have been built. Seagrass beds, coral reefs, tidal flats, and mangrove forests have the ability to capture carbon (blue carbon), and the preservation, restoration, and creation of such ecosystems are expected to contribute to climate change mitigation.[3] Blue carbon, like carbon captured by forests and other terrestrial ecosystems (green carbon), is captured through the absorption of carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, mainly by phytoplankton, microalgae, seaweed, and seagrasses, which are generated, grow, and decompose in a short-term cycle (several days to several years). It is now known that a significant fraction of them contribute to carbon sequestration by being deposited on the seafloor, transported to the deep sea, and remaining at the sea environment as a refractory fraction.[4] Thus, it has been pointed out that the conservation, restoration, and creation of blue carbon ecosystems have co-benefits both in combating climate change and conserving biodiversity. However, the activity has not been mainstreamed. One reason is that the process is in the ocean and is not widely visible by the public, making it difficult for private companies to invest in the project. Moreover, the management of the ecosystem requires detailed manual work, making it difficult to apply industrial methods. Against this situation, for the past 20 years, NPO groups in Japan have been leading activities to restore eelgrass beds through seeding and transplantation, and workshops on wakame seaweed cultivation in port areas. Through these activities, the development of methods for ecosystem restoration has progressed, and activities are now being promoted throughout Japan. This is being driven by the development of the blue carbon market through voluntary carbon credit certification. Currently, a certification organization called Japan Blue Economy association (JBE) is taking the lead in establishing a system in 2021 to use blue carbon generated by citizens, fishermen, and businesses as carbon offsets for purchasing companies.[5] In 2023, 21 projects were certified for 3,733.1 t-CO2. Certified Blue Carbon is purchased by companies to offset their carbon emissions, and is used for corporate CSR and branding, and is returned to the Blue Carbon creators as part of the funds used to ensure the sustainability of their activities. However, monitoring for getting the certification of blue carbon credits requires a high scientific knowledge and resources, and its continuous implementation is difficult. To mainstream the conservation, restoration, and creation of blue carbon ecosystems attract private sector investment and initiate citizens, fishermen, and other local stakeholders participation, it is important to further improve the system and accumulate experience by expanding it to diverse regions. On December 27, 2022, the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) issued a press release on the promotion of ""Blue Infrastructure Expansion Project for Life-Nurturing Ports"". Focusing on the effects of marine and coastal ecosystems in terms of carbon dioxide absorption and water purification, the project aims to contribute to the realization of carbon neutrality through the expansion of carbon dioxide sinks and to enrich marine biodiversity. Through this project, the MLIT aims to expand seagrass beds, seaweed habitats, tidal flats, and other bio-symbiotic port structures by promoting public-private partnerships to take the lead in this effort. We are hoping that this policy decision will encourage more stakeholders to participate in the conservation, restoration, and creation of blue carbon ecosystems. *About the author: Dr Keita Furukawa, Affiliated Research Fellow, the Ocean Policy Research Institute of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation (OPRI/SPF), Japan.

21,"As one of the major blue carbon ecosystems, mangroves provide critical ecosystem services in mitigating global climate change. However, the future complex and variable climate conditions may lead to the uncertainty in trajectories of blue carbon capacity. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2) is projected to become a prominent driver to mangrove blue carbon in the future. A group of scientists working on blue carbon reviewed studies on ""changes in mangrove blue carbon under elevated atmospheric CO2"" to identify the pathways for how eCO2 might influence mangrove ecosystem carbon cycling. The research is published as a review article in Ecosystem health and sustainability, a Science Partner Journal. This review highlights that mangrove has a negative feedback to climate change existed whereby eCO2 added to mangrove's ability to sequester additional carbon, which in turn reduces the rate by which CO2 builds. Furthermore, eCO2 affects warming and sea-level rise through alternate pathways, which might co-influences the mangrove response in both antagonistic and synergistic ways. The scientists suggest to establish more experiments to understand the influence of eCO2 on biological processes that might lead to greenhouse gas emissions, and invest in mesocosm-scale simulation experiments that could provide datasets for prediction in future scenarios. Given the complexity of the interactions of biological and environmental factors with eCO2, long-term field observations and in situ simulation experiments can help to better understand the mechanisms for proper model initialization to predict future changes in mangrove carbon sequestration.

22,"Link to Image Paradise Island in the Bahamas Getty Images / Joannis S Duran / Freelance Photographer Seagrass beds and mangrove trees in the Bahamas' crystal-clear waters may soon be drafted into the fight against climate change.  The Caribbean country plans to offer ""blue carbon"" credits this year as a way for companies internationally to offset their emissions, the country's prime minister announced last week. The island nation will be one of the first to sell ocean-based credits, and hopes to use the proceeds to invest in climate resilience projects.  Coastal ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows and mangrove forests, are some of the world's most powerful carbon sinks, storing three to five times more carbon per hectare than tropical forests. They do so mainly by storing dead and decaying plant matter in the ocean floor, as well as sequestering carbon by pulling it straight from the air and water. Last year, an international team of researchers found that these marine habitats already store up to 30 billion tons of carbon - nearly as much as the world emitted in 2021 from fossil fuel burning alone.  The Bahamas is home to more than 1,600 square miles of mangrove forests and other marine ecosystems that serve as valuable carbon sinks - at least $300 million worth, according to Prime Minister Philip Davis. But they're threatened by damage from hurricanes and coastal development, issues that he said the revenues from the carbon credit sales would help address.  ""I want to see a Caribbean that is not dumped on any further,"" Davis said at the Caribbean Renewable Energy Conference in Miami, according to Bloomberg. ""We are a major carbon sink for the world, and we need to benefit from cleaning the Earth's atmosphere.""  Carbon offsets work in two ways: Companies can pay to preserve already-existing ecosystems, preventing new carbon from being released into the atmosphere. Or they can finance the rehabilitation of degraded or destroyed habitats, which then go on to absorb additional carbon dioxide. Both methods allow corporations and individuals buying credits to continue polluting, as long as their emissions are equal to the carbon being stored by the project they support - the basis for claims to ""carbon neutrality."" In theory, these methods can be an important tool to combat climate change, and conservationists are now promoting blue carbon projects as a way to preserve threatened marine habitats.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations' major climate body, has promoted blue carbon as a way for nations to meet their obligations under the Paris Agreement, and countries like the United States, Australia, and Kenya have already begun including marine habitats in their carbon accounting. Corporations have also seen an opportunity in blue carbon; Apple and Gucci have both invested in projects that preserve mangrove forests in Central and South America.  But similar carbon offset programs targeting forests and grasslands have been plagued with accusations of fraud; developers have been caught inflating the amount of carbon sequestered by forests or preserving land that was already protected. And some ecosystems have been destroyed by wildfires even after they were claimed for credits.  They've also been criticized as a form of ""greenwashing,"" excusing companies and countries from the work of actually transitioning to carbon-free energy sources - a possibility that some experts fear could be repeated with ""blue carbon"" credits.  These issues, however, haven't slowed the rapid expansion of carbon markets, which are expected to be worth as much as $546 billion by 2050, according to BloombergNEF, a clean energy research firm.  ""You shouldn't let anybody convince you or say that this is the silver bullet to solve climate change, because it's not. The opportunity is actually quite limited,"" Cath Lovelock, a coastal ecology researcher at the University of Queensland, Australia, told China Dialogue Ocean. ""And it might allow polluters to keep polluting. It's like: 'Watch my beautiful blue carbon project over here, while I'm not doing anything about my emissions over there.'""

23,"Corporate giants led by BHP and Qantas are among a flurry of investors pushing to buy official ""blue"" carbon credits, based on a newly approved method, that uses coastal wetlands, mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses to absorb greenhouse gases. The challenge is finding the right place to do it, says one of the nation's leading experts in the field, Deakin University's Peter Macreadie. ""It's the closest thing you can possibly get to a true offset,"" Professor Macreadie told The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday during a visit to the East Trinity reserve south of Cairns, the site of one of Australia's most successful mangrove remediation projects. Given the scrutiny of offsets in recent months, Professor Macreadie, head of Deakin's blue carbon lab, said there was a need to develop projects that sequestered carbon faster and for longer. ""These are the ecosystems that can put carbon back in the ground for thousands and thousands of years,"" he said, noting that coastal zones were where fossil fuels originated. ""There has been a kind of awakening to the quality of carbon credits even if the market doesn't reward it. ""To paraphrase George Orwell; all carbon is equal, but some carbon is more equal than others. ""A tonne of blue carbon should attract a premium that should be worth 10 times other forms of abatement, in my opinion."" It is thought that Australia is home to about 12 per cent of the world's blue carbon ecosystems, and more than 200 years of coastal development has created potential restorable mangrove region the size of Portugal, according to Professor Macreadie. Scientists say blue carbon has the benefit of being able to store carbon at up to 40 times the rate of other vegetation. That prompted the federal government to put aside $30 million for a blue carbon fund, with more than half allocated to major coastal restorations. Although voluntary blue carbon credits have been issued overseas, the Australian Emission Reduction Fund approved the first blue carbon method in January. Credits here are yet to be issued. ""Australia is perfectly positioned for a bad reason - because we've drained a lot of our ecosystems and destroyed a lot of them,"" Professor Macreadie said. Their restoration would qualify as a credible source of credits by adding to the store of carbon - meeting the principles of ""additionality"", which is a primary test of such commodities under global rules. ""Many analysts are saying that carbon credits could become one of the world's biggest commodity markets as there are a lot of companies that are trying to reach net zero emissions, and they've included blue carbon in that,"" Professor Macreadie said. ""Whether its Google, or Apple or HSBC and other groups like that, they're really keen for high-quality abatement."" Professor Macreadie said Australia's other advantage was its level of scientific research in the field. ""I think we bat way above our average in terms of our knowledge of these ecosystems and what we could be doing,"" he said. Yesterday, BHP announced a $3 million grants program to develop ""shovel-ready"" blue carbon projects. The mining giant is also helping support a CSIRO project to map and estimate the potential CO2 of Australia's blue carbon ecosystems. Restoring coastal wetlands can take many forms, but some are relatively simple, such as restoring tidal flows to spur mangrove growth, or putting up fences to keep out cattle and other ruminants. The challenge is finding the appropriate parcels of land. ""There's so much investor appetite for blue carbon, but there's no supply of projects for them to invest in,"" Professor Macreadie said. ""And some of the reasons [are] social challenges, some governance challenges, some economic challenges, even challenges from a technological point of view about measuring blue carbon at low cost and abatement. ""Fortunately, the new [ERF] method allows that to be done using models, people actually don't need to go in the field and spend a lot of money in measuring that,"" he said during a visit to the East Trinity reserve, a 774-hectare section of mangroves directly across Trinity Inlet from the Cairns CBD. The area was cleared in the early 1970s, levelled and bounded with a seven-kilometre earth wall to plant sugar cane. The changes resulted in a catastrophic surge in sulphuric acids that drained into the Great Barrier Reef, killing fish. In 2000, the Queensland government acquired the land and began one of the world's most successful large-scale acid sulphate soil remediation projects. Next time such a project takes place, there may also be valuable carbon credits attached. The author travelled to Cairns as a guest of the Carbon Market Institute.

24,"(TNSres) -- Conservation International issued the following news release: At the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Conservation International, along with Salesforce and a global coalition of ocean leaders, announced a new set of principles to build investable, high-quality blue carbon projects to ensure positive outcomes for people, nature and climate. The ""High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles and Guidance"" is a first-of-a-kind blue carbon framework to guide the development and purchasing of high-quality blue carbon projects and credits. The High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles and Guidance seeks to provide a consistent and accepted framework for blue carbon credits for credit purchasers, investors, suppliers and project developers. This shared vision for quality can serve a foundational role in building confidence and momentum around blue carbon project development and investments. The five principles, each of equal importance, are: * Safeguard nature * Empower people * Employ the best information and carbon accounting principles * Operate contextually and locally * Mobilize high integrity capital High-quality, nature-based carbon credits are a powerful tool for driving climate mitigation and resilience through the conservation and restoration of nature. As organizations race to achieve their net zero commitments, the global voluntary carbon market is estimated to grow to US$50 billion by 2030. Blue carbon - the carbon captured and sequestered by marine ecosystems - is experiencing a particularly rapid increase in demand. The Principles and Guidance seeks to channel this demand toward optimizing outcomes for people, nature and climate in a transparent and equitable way. ""Because we're seeing such high demand for blue carbon credits, it's important that we maintain their quality as the market expands,"" said Dr. Jennifer Howard, Vice President of the Blue Carbon Program at Conservation International's Center for Natural Climate Solutions. ""We want to ensure that every blue carbon credit is high quality, and these principles will help us get there. They're designed to guide us - on both the developer and buyer ends of the transaction - in finding the credits that best serve the nature and people they're intended to support."" In 2021, Dr. Howard led Conservation International in the rollout of blue carbon credits from a mangrove forest in Cispata, Colombia that became the world's first mangrove site to have its carbon fully quantified and subsequently enter the blue carbon market for sale. This year, the project reported that 100% of all available blue carbon credits had been sold. More credits are expected to be available in 2023. ""We set out to define a vision for high-quality blue carbon across all aspects of a project over its lifetime. We recognize that it's unlikely that any given project will meet every element of the guidance in full tomorrow. Our intent is not to set a bar that is impossible to achieve and therefore exclusionary, but rather to provide guidance and perhaps more importantly a pathway for delivering the best possible outcomes,"" said Dr. Howard. The principles were derived through a global consultative process, consolidating existing knowledge and best practices to provide a shared vision for achieving high-quality blue carbon projects and credits for all stakeholders. ""This framework is one contribution to the growing dialogue around high-quality blue carbon,"" said Dr. Whitney Johnston, Salesforce Director of Ocean Sustainability. ""We hope these principles will serve as a foundation for actions that ensure equity, accountability, transparency, and sustainability in the blue carbon space."" ""People must be at the center of our nature and climate strategies. It's imperative that we open pathways for local and indigenous communities to equitably participate in and benefit from blue carbon projects, while we work to reverse nature loss and combat climate change."" Dr. Johnston added. The development of the framework was driven by a collaborative effort between Salesforce, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance (ORRAA), Friends of Ocean Action/Ocean Action Agenda at the World Economic Forum, and the Meridian Institute. * * * Original text here: https://www.conservation.org/press-releases/2022/11/09/high-quality-blue-carbon-principles-and-guidance-seeks-to-drive-sustainability-and-equity-in-the-blue-carbon-market [Category: Environment] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-7992602 MSTRUCK Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: BLUE ECONOMY (90%); CONSERVATION (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); SUSTAINABILITY (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (90%); CARBON OFFSETS (89%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (78%); UNITED NATIONS (78%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (78%); CARBON CAPTURE & STORAGE (77%) Organization: CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION (94%) Industry: BLUE ECONOMY (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (90%); CARBON OFFSETS (89%); ACCOUNTING (53%) Geographic: EGYPT (79%)"
25,"(TNSres) -- Conservation International issued the following news release on June 23, 2022: Conservation International today issued its inaugural impact report for the mangrove project in Cispata, Colombia, known locally as Vida Manglar. Last year, the mangrove forest became the first to enter the carbon market with its carbon stores fully calculated and verified as blue carbon credits. The report reveals that 100% of Vida Manglar's available carbon credits have been sold or are currently in the process of being traded. A full 92 percent of the funds generated from these sales will be invested back into Vida Manglar's conservation management plan - generating a reliable source of financing to protect the mangroves and support the communities that rely on them. Finally, the report also confirms that the project is expected to issue a new round of carbon credits in 2023 and that the government of Colombia is seeking to replicate this successful flagship project in six other locations along the Caribbean coast - scaling it up into a national program and bringing the concept of market-driven conservation to new areas. Meaning ""Mangrove Life"" in English, the Vida Manglar project began in late 2018 with support from Apple, along with INVEMAR Research Institute, the Omacha Foundation, and Colombia's environmental authorities CVS and CARSUCRE alongside Conservation International and local communities. In early 2021, Vida Manglar began selling Verified Carbon Units on the international carbon market. ""This impact report shows a high demand for blue carbon credits, which are still new to the voluntary carbon market,"" said Maria Claudia Diazgranados Cadelo, Director of Conservation International's blue carbon program. ""To have nearly all credits from the first issuance sold in just under one year is very encouraging, and its success should serve as a green light to other organizations or communities considering similar projects around the world."" The Vida Manglar project is the first mangrove forest to fully account for the carbon stored both above water, and below it. Mangrove forests are a powerhouse for carbon storage. Hectare for hectare, they store up to 10 times more carbon than terrestrial forests -- and if they are destroyed, all that carbon is released, contributing to climate change. The project's 11,000-hectare (27,000-acre) mangrove forest is expected to sequester nearly 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over its 30-year lifespan - roughly equivalent to taking 184,000 cars off the road for one year. Cispata Bay's five species of mangroves provide habitats for migratory birds, sea turtles, manatees, otters and American crocodiles, known locally as needle-nose crocodiles. ""Around the world, demand for blue carbon outweighs the supply quite significantly,"" said Jennifer Howard, Senior Director of Conservation International's blue climate program. ""The results from our work in Cispata will offer important proof of concept, which is needed to build investor confidence and demonstrates the value of high-quality blue carbon offsets."" The Vida Manglar project's carbon stores were fully certified in 2021 using the Verified Carbon Standard and the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards developed by Verra.

26,"Cairns | Corporate giants led by BHP and Qantas are among a flurry of investors pushing to purchase official carbon credits based on a newly approved method that uses coastal wetlands, mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses to absorb greenhouse gases. The challenge is finding the right place to do it, says one of the nation's leading experts in the field, Deakin University's Peter Macreadie. ""It's the closest thing you can possibly get to a true offset,"" Professor Macreadie told The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday during a visit to the East Trinity reserve south of Cairns, the site of one of Australia's most successful mangrove remediation projects. Given the scrutiny of offsets in recent months, Professor Macreadie, head of Deakin's blue carbon lab, said there was a need to develop projects that sequestered carbon faster and for longer. ""These are the ecosystems that can put carbon back in the ground for thousands and thousands of years,"" he said, noting that coastal zones were where fossil fuels originate. ""There has been a kind of awakening to the quality of carbon credits even if the market doesn't reward it. ""To paraphrase George Orwell; all carbon is equal, but some carbon is more equal than others. ""A tonne of blue carbon should attract a premium that should be worth 10 times other forms of abatement, in my opinion."" Blue carbon fund It is thought that Australia is home to about 12 per cent of the world's blue carbon ecosystems, and more than 200 years of coastal development has created potential restorable mangrove region the size of Portugal, according to Professor Macreadie. Scientists say blue carbon has the benefit of being able to store carbon at up to 40 times the rate of other vegetation. That feature prompted the federal government to put aside $30 million for a blue carbon fund, with more than half allocated to major coastal restorations. Although voluntary blue carbon credits have been issued overseas, the Australian Emission Reduction Fund approved the first blue carbon method in January. Credits here are yet to be issued. ""Australia is perfectly positioned for a bad reason - because we've drained a lot of our ecosystems and destroyed a lot of them,"" Professor Macreadie said. Their restoration would qualify as a credible source of credits by adding to the store of carbon - meeting the principles of ""additionality"", which is a primary test of such commodities under global rules. ""Many analysts are saying that carbon credits could become one of the world's biggest commodity markets as there are a lot of companies that are trying to reach net zero emissions, and they've included blue carbon in that,"" Professor Macreadie said. ""Whether its Google, or Apple or HSBC and other groups like that, they're really keen for high-quality abatement."" Professor Macreadie said Australia's other advantage was its level of scientific research in the field. ""I think we bat way above our average in terms of our knowledge of these ecosystems and what we could be doing,"" he said. ""And we're also young enough as a country to start to import and co-operate better frameworks, environmental economic accounting frameworks that do start to value ecosystems for more than just carbon, but for all those other things they do for us."" BHP on Thursday announced a $3 million grants program to develop ""shovel-ready"" blue carbon projects. The mining giant is also helping support a CSIRO project to map and estimate the potential CO2 of Australia's blue carbon ecosystems. Restoration is key Restoring coastal wetlands can take many forms, but some are relatively simple, such as restoring tidal flows to spur mangrove growth, or putting up fences to keep out cattle and other ruminants. The challenge is finding the appropriate parcels of land. ""There's so much investor appetite for blue carbon, but there's no supply of projects for them to invest in,"" Professor Macreadie said. ""And some of the reasons [are] social challenges, some governance challenges, some economic challenges, even challenges from a technological point of view about measuring blue carbon at low cost and abatement. ""Fortunately, the new [ERF] method allows that to be done using models, people actually don't need to go in the field and spend a lot of money in measuring that,"" he said during a visit to the East Trinity reserve, a 774-hectare section of mangroves directly across Trinity Inlet from the Cairns CBD. The area was cleared in the early 1970s, levelled and bounded with a seven-kilometre earth wall to plant sugar cane. The changes resulted in a catastrophic surge in sulphuric acids that drained into the Great Barrier Reef, killing fish. In 2000, the Queensland government acquired the land and began one of the world's most successful large-scale acid sulphate soil remediation projects. Next time such a project takes place, there may also be valuable carbon credits attached. The author travelled to Cairns as a guest of the Carbon Market Institute.

27,"Costa Rica becomes the first country in Central America and the second in Latin America to restore mangrove ecosystems by rehabilitating, at scale, the hydrological conditions of the area. With the help of Conservation International, Costa Rica becomes the first country in Central America and the second in Latin America and the world to restore mangrove ecosystems by rehabilitating, at scale, the hydrological conditions of the area to allow species to repopulate at a natural rate, creating new economic opportunities for local communities and resource sustainability for the country. The project, led by Conservation International, in conjunction with the National Wetlands Program of the National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC/MINAE), in collaboration with the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE), and thanks to the support of the Pure Land Foundation, develops actions to rehabilitate the proper tidal inlet in sites within the mangroves of the Estero Puntarenas Wetland and Cipancí National Wildlife Refuge, which were deteriorated or completely transformed into crops. With the entry of the tides through the channels made, the soil will eventually recover the humidity and salinity necessary for the seedlings of the different mangrove species to settle and naturally recover these areas. ""Mangroves are the heroes among the trees, providing a number of vital ecosystem services to society in general and more so to the surrounding coastal communities, yet these forests are often overlooked. For example, they are a protective barrier against storm surges and storms, they filter water coming from the land to the sea, and among their roots more than 80% of species of commercial interest are protected and fed at some point in their lives. In addition, they are blue carbon ecosystems, which by their nature can store up to five times more carbon than mature tropical forests"" emphasizes Ana Gloria Guzman, director of Conservation International Costa Rica. The project is ambitious, based and consolidated on science and research, combining engineering, commitment and work with communities and collaboration with institutions and government. It is positioned as a pilot to be replicated along the coasts of the country and the world. It began with the analysis of historical aerial photographs of the original mangroves, with the objective of identifying the original riverbeds, which were altered for the growth of sugar cane crops, the establishment of salt and shrimp production activities, as well as natural causes. For the rehabilitation, topographic studies were also carried out, as well as studies of the chemical conditions of the soil and the health of the mangrove ecosystem in the area. As of November 2022, around 20,000m of canals have been constructed within the open areas and 1,300m of estuaries have been cleaned and enlarged, including the cleaning of slopes, removal of obstacles in the constructed channels, opening of new channels, as well as cleaning of existing channels. The project incorporates nearby communities in the area such as El Establo, Pitahaya, Níspero and San Buenaventura, including their knowledge about the area, about how this ecosystem used to be before it was modified, and about the conditions that can facilitate its recovery. As Danilo Torres Gómez, CATIE forestry engineer, points out, mangrove restoration is a gradual process: ""First, a baseline study is carried out to learn about the conditions of a nearby reference mangrove, to understand the historical context and carry out carbon sampling, because the project focuses on carbon. At the same time, we are studying the surrounding communities, looking for entities that collaborate with the daily work (opening, canals, cleaning of the sites...) and who, possibly in the future, will help with maintenance and monitoring"". ""The communities near the mangrove forests are those who benefit most directly from their services, but also those who suffer the immediate consequences of the loss of these ecosystems. That is why the project seeks to work hand in hand with the local people, so that they become the true protectors of the mangrove forests and can develop sustainable activities thanks to the conservation and recovery of these ecosystems,"" Guzmán adds. According to the National Wetlands Policy and other current policies, the country has the responsibility to restore mangrove ecosystems. As recently defined, the country has the potential to restore 14,336 hectares of mangroves along the Pacific coast of the country, of which 1,500 hectares are in the Gulf of Nicoya. This project has rehabilitated more than 300 hectares in the Estero Puntarenas Wetland and Cipancí National Refuge, and represents a first, but key, phase of support for the country to reach its national goals. In order to continue strengthening the country's efforts, Conservation International seeks to design and support the implementation of a Blue Carbon Community Development Model. This model, as a variant of the Payment for Ecosystem Services Program - an initiative that was pioneered in its time and has generated wide international recognition for Costa Rica - will allow progress towards achieving the goals in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) assumed by the country as part of the Paris Agreement. ""Costa Rica already monitors mangroves, we have an ecological baseline and we can estimate carbon sequestration. With this we can determine restoration priorities, which is fundamental to be able to report our contributions to the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory"" highlights Jacklyn Rivera, Coordinator of the National Wetlands Program of the National System of Conservation Areas.

28,"(TNSres) -- Deakin University issued the following news release: * * * Researchers at Deakin University's Blue Carbon Lab have commenced trialling the use of biodegradable structures to enhance the growth and survival of coastal wetland species, planted as part of restoration work in Port Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay. * * * The structures, made from potato starch, provide seedlings with protection from high-energy environments without limiting their growth. They break down over time, making way for the established plants to thrive. Coastal wetlands, such as mangrove forests and saltmarshes, provide many benefits including protection from storm surges, and habitat for coastal wildlife. They also store atmospheric carbon, acting as a nature-based solution against climate change. However, coastal wetlands have been degraded and lost around the world and restoring them can be challenging. Dr Stacey Trevathan-Tackett of Deakin University's Blue Carbon Lab says that restoration efforts can be hampered by harsh environmental conditions that damage wetland plants at crucial early stages of their growth and so it's important to constantly come up with new methods to encourage growth. ""We are exploring new ways to help improve the success of restoration and recovery of wetlands,"" Dr Trevathan-Tackett said. ""This includes trialling new and creative techniques in different habitats and conditions, as well as working with local communities along the way."" While mangrove seeds planted into these structures over the summer have started to sprout, researchers want to quantify survival and growth over time and determine how the novel approach is working and to make improvements along the way. The project, titled Regenerating Our Coasts, is a three-year program partnered with Beach Energy that focuses on research and outreach. Beach's CEO Morne Engelbrecht said: ""Beach Energy is proud to partner with Deakin Uni's Blue Carbon Lab to support research to help restore blue carbon ecosystems and accelerate coastal restoration. This is Beach's largest ever environmental partnership and demonstrates our commitment to leaving a positive contribution to communities."" ""With the Regenerating Our Coasts program, we are excited to see seedlings beginning to grow through the structures,"" said Dr Trevathan-Tackett. ""But they have a long way to go, and so do we in terms of trialling different approaches to maximise what this method can do."" Not all coastal wetlands are the same, different environmental conditions, historical impacts, and even the types of plants and animals present influence the restoration success. With such diversity at play, the Blue Carbon Lab team aim to optimise these structures across different wetlands and plant species in Victoria's Port Phillip Bay and Western Port Bay. The trial site in Western Port has enlisted the help of citizen scientists, who will measure both the survival and growth of a batch of mangrove seedlings. The data collected as part of ongoing monitoring will help the researchers further develop restoration approaches at local mangrove sites. ""We see outreach as a vital part of the project,"" said Dr Trevathan-Tackett. ""Engaging with communities through education and knowledge-exchange means that more people understand the problem and support what we're doing to solve it. In turn, by getting involved in citizen science activities, they are contributing to research projects that will ultimately benefit restoration efforts.""

It is the most diverse and best-developed natural mangrove community on the north of the Tropic of Cancer in China. Mangroves, salt marshes e.g. reed marshes, short-leaf water chestnut saltmarshes were the dominant communities here. Kandelia obovata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Avicennia marina are the dominant species.The mangroves here has high natural attributes and typical mangrove community characteristics, so the reserve is of great value for conservation and research and is a treasure of wetland biodiversity.  The local residents in the Zhangjiang Estuary generally take up tidal flat aquaculture, farming, and working out as their main sources of income. There is a close relationship between the residents daily life and mangrove conservation. Tidal flat aquaculturewas an important income for the residents in Zhuta Village, located in the project area. In recent years, the reserve authorities have carried out part of the work of returning ponds to forests. The ongoing education and awareness on mangrove protection helped increasing the rates of returning ponds to forests. Meanwhile, looking for alternative livelihoods and ensuring the lives of residents in the area is also the focus of future protection of local mangrove forests.  Mangroves have ecological functions in terms of sequestering carbon, increasing carbon sinks and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Blue carbon has potential significance for the protection, management and restoration of mangroves, and is one of the global strategies curb climate change and global warming. In the global blue carbon voluntary market, there have been eleven mangrove carbon sink trading projects. In September 2021, the first project of blue carbon transaction in Fujian Province of China was successfully completed, based on the ""Mangrove Carbon Sinks Afforestation Methodology"" developed by the applicant, Dr. Luzhen Chen. This transaction is highly market-oriented, which is Clearing invasive Spartina alterniflora and planting mangroves, reflecting the coordination of biological invasion control and mangrove restoration,biodiversity protection and community development. Therefore, mangrove blue carbon trading can become a part of the alternative livelihoods for local communities. The development of future carbon trading models can provide financial support for both the restoration and protection of the mangroves and community development.

30,"ABU DHABI, 2nd June, 2022 (WAM) -- The Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) has announced that it's Blue Carbon Environmental and Social Responsibility Project, in collaboration with ENGIE and Distant Imagery, has been selected among the 12 Uplink Ocean Top Innovations. The drone technology developed by Distant Imagery for the EAD was one of the winners of the Blue Carbon Challenge, which was launched by Friends of Ocean Action, Uplink and the Mangroves Working Group. Conservation International, Coastal Oceans Research and Development – Indian Ocean (CORDIO) East Africa, REV Ocean, and GIB Asset Management were also part of the effort as supporting partners. The Blue Carbon Challenge on UpLink recognises innovative solutions, projects, and enabling tools that can harness the potential of blue carbon markets to support environmental conservation, habitat restoration, and coastal management for people, nature, and help combat climate change. The selected 12 UpLink Ocean Top Innovators will receive technical support and valuable connections to implement their projects. The Blue Carbon Project involves striving to plant more than 35,000 mangrove seeds in the Mirfa Lagoon in Abu Dhabi, using highly innovative drone planting technology. This project aligns with the recent ambition by the UAE entitled the Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative launched by H.H. Sheikh Khalid bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, member of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council and Chairman of Abu Dhabi Executive Office, and Prince William, Duke of Edinburgh, in February of this year. Ahmed Al Hashmi, Executive Director - Terrestrial & Marine Biodiversity, said, ""Our project was very ambitious and pioneering because it had never been done before in the region. Through using cutting-edge drone technology to plant mangroves, we are striving for high success rates for restoration."" He added that Blue Carbon - carbon stored in aquatic ecosystems, like mangrove forests and seagrass beds - has the potential to store five times as much carbon per square foot as terrestrial ecosystems. ""Through projects like ours, we will be able to reduce emissions and capture carbon in natural carbon sinks offering a transitional step to Net-Zero by 2050, which is one of the main goals of the UAE.""  ""We are delighted that through our partnership with the EAD, we have evolved our drone technology. Our collective success is thanks to adoption of an ecological-led approach throughout each project phase; the seeds are dropped at the right time, tide level, soil depth, and in the perfect location, but it is nature that takes it course and makes it a success,"" stated Jane Glavan, Co-founder, Distant Imagery. Florence Fontani, Vice President Communications and Sustainability, ENGIE Africa, Middle East, and Asia, said that the project demonstrates a novel approach to rehabilitating the Emirate's mangrove habitats using drone technology. ""An effective way to mitigate the effects of climate change and restore natural habitats and biodiversity, we look forward to sharing the learnings of this first-of-its-kind project and implementing similar initiatives that will accelerate our goals towards carbon-neutrality."" The UAE based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle environmental analysis company, Distant Imagery, developed highly accurate maps and analysed potential planting sites. Distant Imagery drones made from simple and scalable 3D-printed components, coupled with very accurate planting, can be a benchmark in mangrove restoration. Their technology can drop 2,000 germinated seeds, or 500 seedballs, in ten minutes.

31,"(TNSpp) -- Earth Day Network issued the following news: Lining the calm, blue water, green trees with intricate roots stand out and dig deep, pointing to the fish swimming by and guiding the way to a forest full of an array of animals. Sounds like the opening shot of a movie, but this is a reality. The beautiful mangrove forests, found in various continents, are a critical source for communities and are home to a vast number of species. Mangroves are trees and shrubs with characteristically intricate, exposed roots that form a type of tropical forest typically located near bodies of water. More importantly, mangroves host the most diverse, beautiful, and resource-abundant ecosystems in the world. However, the rise in deforestation and the looming danger of sea-level rise have threatened the mangroves habitat, putting the area's biodiversity as well as local communities at risk. Here are five reasons as to why mangrove ecosystems are important along with the consequences that can occur if these areas are lost. 1. Mangroves act as carbon sinks. Due to mangroves' roots which anchor the plants into underwater sediment, nutrients and organic material from the tidal waves enriches the soils, giving mangroves the ability to store carbon, otherwise known as blue carbon. Mangrove forests are able to store up to four times more carbon than other tropical forests. Cutting down mangroves will only result in a mass release of carbon into the atmosphere. 2. Mangrove forests are biodiversity hotspots. Mangrove ecosystems are home to a myriad of species from marine life (fish, crab, shellfish, sea turtle, etc) to birds. The habitat serves as a nesting, breeding, and nursing ground for the plethora of local wildlife. As more and more mangrove forests are cleared, valuable habitat is lost and species such as the Bengal tiger are at risk of extinction. 3. Mangroves improve and maintain local water quality. Mangroves' network of roots and lush vegetation filters pollutants and traps sediments, preventing contamination of the waterways and protecting the habitats and the species within them. Local groups and those that live near the rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water nearby are also protected by the trees' maintenance of the water quality. 4. Mangrove forests double as coastal protection. Mangrove forests act as a physical buffer between marine and terrestrial communities. The trees protect the coastlines from severe weather events as well as slow down erosion. The mangroves provide valuable protection for those nearby communities that are prone to storms and are at risk of sea-level rise. 5. Mangroves provide essential resources for people. The mangrove forests hold a variety of resources ranging from leaves used in tea and livestock feed to plant extracts used as medicine. Millions of people rely on the mangroves for food, income, and wellbeing, particularly, the forest waters provide an abundance of fish for local fishermen to sell and maintain financial stability. To estimate, 80% of the global fish catch relies on mangrove forests either directly or indirectly through the support of terrestrial and marine food webs. The mangrove forests are a beautiful gift of nature. Not only are the forests a wondrous sight to behold, the benefits and resources provided are immeasurable. EARTHDAY.ORG's campaign, The Canopy Project, works towards safeguarding the mangrove forests in Bangladesh and India by planting trees, strengthening the local communities, and rehabilitating the areas directly affected by the effects of climate change. By donating to The Canopy Project, you can help protect these important mangrove ecosystems as they are a safe haven for the wildlife and local people who call the forest their home. * * * Original text here: https://www.earthday.org/the-importance-of-mangrove-forests/ [Category: Environment] Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8073405 MSTRUCK Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: ECOSYSTEMS & HABITATS (90%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS (90%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); BIODIVERSITY (89%); COASTAL AREAS (89%); CONSERVATION (89%); WATER RESOURCES (89%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (88%); WATER QUALITY (88%); COASTAL CONSERVATION (87%); BLUE ECONOMY (78%); DEFORESTATION (78%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (78%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS CONSERVATION (78%); LIFE FORMS (78%); POLLUTION (78%); WATER POLLUTION (78%); WETLANDS CONSERVATION (78%); WILDLIFE (78%); ANIMALS (77%); MAMMALS (77%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (74%); NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS (74%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (74%); SEA LEVEL CHANGES (74%); HABITAT CONSERVATION (73%); LAKES (72%); REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS (72%); EROSION CONTROL (71%); WEATHER (69%); NEGATIVE NEWS (68%); SEVERE WEATHER (60%) Industry: BLUE ECONOMY (78%); CANALS & WATERWAYS (78%); DEFORESTATION (78%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (78%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS CONSERVATION (78%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (74%); LIVESTOCK (73%); LIVESTOCK FEED (61%)"
32,"By Hou Liqiang | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-06-09 17:35 A senior expert called for intensified efforts to protect ecosystems in coastal waters because of their significant ability to absorb carbon while speaking at forum on Wednesday, which is also World Oceans Day. Covering about 71 percent of the Earth's surface, the ocean holds about 40 trillion metric tons of carbon - about 50 times more than in the air, said Zhou Hongchun, a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council, at a forum organized by the All-China Environment Federation. He noted the strong capabilities of three coastal ecosystems in soaking up carbon - mangrove forests, sea grass beds and salt marshes. Occupying only 0.5 percent of the seabed, they soak up more than half the carbon the ocean holds. Mangrove forests, for example, only cover 0.5 percent of the world's coastal areas. In the sediment held by mangrove trees, however, the content of carbon reaches 10 to 15 percent. ""The tree is a master of capturing blue carbon,"" Zhou noted. Blue carbon refers to the carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems. From this point of view, marine management authorities should make efforts to promote ecosystem restoration and conservation in coastal areas, he stressed. World Oceans Day is celebrated annually on June 8.

33,"2023 MAR 08 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- Research findings on Global Warming and Climate Change are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting from Corpus Christi, Texas, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, ""Mangrove ecosystems with high sediment deposition and active carbon cycling are a source of methane (CH4) to the coastal atmosphere. We investigated diurnal and seasonal variations in CH4 emissions from a subtropical mangrove estuary in southern Texas, northwest Gulf of Mexico.""   Financial supporters for this research include National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi Student Research Competition, Geological Society of America Graduate Student Grants.   The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Texas A&M University, ""Tidal processes, amplitude (spring vs. neap tides) and topographic characteristics are crucial factors controlling CH4 cycling in mangrove creeks. Higher CH4 concentrations were observed during the ebb in spring tides due to the combination of processive export of CH4 along the creeks during ebb tides and the addition of porewater CH4 in upper intertidal sediment under water inundation in spring tides. The annual CH4 emissions offset approximately 0.15% of the carbon stock in normal years, indicating that these mangrove creeks are a weak CH4 source. However, significantly elevated CH4 emissions were observed from mangrove dieback after the extreme cold-freezing event in February 2021. The average CH4 flux from the mangrove creeks (126.1 +/- 128.3 mu mol [m(2)center dot d](-1)) increased 45% in 3 months after mangrove die-off in comparison with the overall average in normal years (87.0 +/- 64.4 mu mol [m(2)center dot d](-1)). It is obvious that the previous small CH4 offset of the healthy mangrove forest was enlarged by the dieback event.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Because the mangrove forests in this study live close to the limit of their survival range, our study highlights the important management considerations for blue carbon projects in vulnerable areas.""

34,"Marine ecosystems have a valuable role to play in mitigating the effects of climate change. That's because such ecosystems - and, particularly, vegetated tidal ecosystems like mangroves and salt marshes - capture and store a significant amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO?). CO? has accumulated in Earth's atmosphere at unprecedented levels since the industrial revolution. Scientific evidence shows this is the primary driver of climate change. ""Blue carbon"", the term used to describe CO? absorbed by marine ecosystems, was an important topic of discussion at last year's COP27 talks in Egypt. More countries are bringing blue carbon into their climate change plans and policies. Indonesia, for example, has made climate adaptation and mitigation efforts that focus on blue carbon a key component for achieving its Nationally Determined Contributions target by 2030. But, partly because of gaps in scientific knowledge, countries may not know how much potential blue carbon they have or where it is located. There are also ecological, social and economic aspects to consider. These differ from place to place, so (although guidelines exist and countries can learn from each other) a ""one size fits all"" approach isn't useful. South Africa is globally recognised for its marine heritage. Its marine ecosystems are not only beautiful and diverse: they also bring economic and social benefits through job creation and contributing to food security. This makes it an imperative to implement targeted climate change policies for marine and coastal ecosystems - and to centre blue carbon in these plans. Our recent study was the first national blue carbon sink assessment for South Africa. It offers a comprehensive estimate of blue carbon storage across the country. That's an important element in supporting the development of evidence-based blue carbon strategies. While national blue carbon stocks are naturally limited by the distribution of mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses; South Africa does have existing policies that can be used to protect and restore these ecosystems. Creating a database Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses are the definitive blue carbon ecosystems. Unlike forests, or other terrestrial ecosystems, more than 90% of the carbon is locked into the soil rather than in the plants themselves. The soils of blue carbon ecosystems are waterlogged with salty seawater. This prevents the stored organic carbon from being converted back to CO? through remineralisation. If left undisturbed and subject to certain conditions, these carbon stocks can build up over centuries. In total, we found that blue carbon ecosystems in South Africa cover a relatively small area of around 18,500 hectares. That represents only 0.015% of the total land area. This is because mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses can only occur in estuaries with certain environmental conditions, making their distribution quite limited.  Read more: Mangrove forests won't be able to spread further in South Africa, so protecting them is crucial Next, we needed to calculate how much CO? these blue carbon ecosystems hold. To do so, we collated the information about where mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses occur with the available data from studies that have measured carbon stocks. Using guidelines developed by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we also estimated CO? emissions from blue carbon ecosystems for the period from 1930 to 2020. These emissions are linked to certain human activities. For example, if a salt marsh is completely removed and replaced with hard infrastructure, it is assumed that all the carbon it stored has been lost and converted back into CO?. However, if some of the natural area remains, then only a portion of the carbon stock has been lost, particularly if the soil is still intact, as this is where most of the carbon is stored. We estimated that total ecosystem carbon stocks per unit area (in megagrams of carbon per hectare) range from 253-534 Mg C ha?¹ for mangroves to 100-199 Mg C ha?¹ for salt marshes and 45-144 Mg C ha?¹ for seagrasses. This is more than the top three vegetated natural terrestrial ecosystems in South Africa: indigenous forest, grasslands and thicket. We also found that 26%, or about 6,500 hectares, of the historical extent of blue carbon ecosystems has been lost through human activities. This has led to historical emissions on average of 30,266 tonnes of CO? per year. For comparison, the CO? emissions per passenger on a flight from Johannesburg to Durban is estimated at 0.0736 tonnes of CO? per year: one person would need to make the trip about 400,000 times in a year to equal the emissions lost from blue carbon ecosystems. Some of the degraded blue carbon ecosystems could be restored. Done successfully, this could increase the total annual carbon sequestration of blue carbon ecosystems by 18%. Blue carbon future Our findings offer important information about South Africa's blue carbon ecosystems. Protecting and managing these ecosystems, we argue, needs to be integrated into coastal management practices, biodiversity conservation, national and provincial climate adaptation strategies, and blue economy planning. This won't require new laws. South Africa has a number of existing policies and measures that can be used to reach these goals. But it will require a concerted effort across all spheres of government (local, provincial, and national) to prioritise and mainstream blue carbon ecosystem protection and sustainable use. Our study identified principal climate change mitigation opportunities with co - benefits for adaptation and biodiversity conservation. These include conservation and rehabilitation activities that can be used under article 6 of the Paris Agreement under marked based approaches to service Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use sectoral targets of the climate change mitigation system for South Africa.

36,"Jakarta, Aug. 9 -- Maritime and Natural Resources Deputy at the National Development and Planning Agency (Bappenas) J. Rizal Primana encouraged G20 member countries to realize a sustainable blue carbon ecosystem in order to handle climate change. During the G20 Seminar on Blue Carbon titled ""Enabling Conservation and Financial Capital"" in Bali, Monday, he noted that the impact of sustainable blue carbon will emerge in the long term. G20 is an international forum comprising 19 countries that work together to handle major issues. Indonesia is holding the presidency of the grouping this year. The blue carbon potential in Indonesia reached 3.4 GT, or around 17 percent of the world's blue carbon, and is spread around coastal ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and peatlands. Such coastal ecosystems can assist in absorbing carbon emissions in the atmosphere as well as the ocean and then storing them in leaves, stems, branches, roots, and sediments. The planning for shoreline conservation and space management in Indonesia emphasizes on aligning with the principle of sustainability, so that the blue carbon ecosystem can contribute more towards reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, Primana stated. If the management continues to be bolstered with adaptation and mitigation toward climate resilience, then Indonesia can contribute more towards reducing greenhouse emissions by up to 29 percent nationally and 41 percent globally until 2030, he remarked. To this end, he stressed that now is the right time to ensure that the ecosystem can be a main priority in shoreline conservation and space management in Indonesia and the world. Moreover, mangrove and seagrass are able to absorb and store large quantities of natural carbon for longer periods of time as compared to terrestrial forests. Maintaining the coastal ecosystem, both mangrove forest and seagrass beds, can provide various benefits, such as preventing erosion and protecting residents' houses during sea tides, storms, and floods. It can also capture polluting materials in the air and the sea while also serving as a habitat for biological creatures specifically residing in the shoreline area. Primana pressed for urgent actions to maintain and rehabilitate the blue carbon ecosystem that has increasingly degraded. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Antara News.

37,"Washington DC: Smithsonian has issued the following press release: Researchers from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) recently published a study in the journal Science of the Total Environment introducing the first national estimate of mangrove carbon stocks in Belize. These findings are the first data released from the Belize Blue Carbon project, an international effort to develop nationwide mangrove datasets to understand implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Blue carbon—carbon stored in marine and coastal ecosystems—is extremely important in the fight against climate change. Mangroves, types of plants that grow in coastal waters, are among the most ecologically valuable marine ecosystems in the world. One of their most important services is taking carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it below ground in their root system and the surrounding soil. It is estimated that mangroves store 12 billion metric tons of carbon worldwide. When these systems are damaged, they emit their stored carbon back into the atmosphere, where it contributes to climate change. While mangroves have long been recognized as important nature-based solutions for long-term carbon storage, many countries still lack local data on carbon stocks and instead rely on global or regional averages, which can significantly over- or underestimate their stock evaluations. This is of special concern because under the Paris Agreement, signatory countries are responsible for producing plans, termed nationally determined contributions (NDCs), on how they will reduce their carbon emissions. Larger scale averages might not represent the actual amount of carbon stored within the mangrove ecosystems of that country. The Belize Blue Carbon project team worked collaboratively to build local capacity and share knowledge to fill gaps around carbon storage in Belize ’ s mangroves. In September 2021, the team sampled a broad range of mangrove ecotypes across Belize to estimate their carbon stocks. The team combined the data they collected with data from a recent mapping effort to create Belize ’ s first national comprehensive mangrove carbon stock estimate. The almost 58,000 hectares of mangroves in Belize were found to hold 25.7 million metric tons of carbon. The team found that their total carbon estimate varied greatly from estimates derived from global or regional averages, highlighting the need for similar localized work in other countries. The team also worked with stakeholders at all levels, including governments, non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and local scientists, to share knowledge in standardized blue carbon sampling methods, create pathways for data sharing and collaborate on the expansion of new efforts. In addition to SERC, key project partners included the University of Belize Environmental Research Institute, the Pew Charitable Trusts, Silvestrum Climate Associates, World Wildlife Fund, Belize Fisheries Department, Belize Forest Department, National Climate Change Office, Coastal Zone Management Authority & Institute, Toledo Institute for Development and Environment, Sarteneja Alliance for Conservation and Development, the Corozal Sustainable Future Initiative, and the Turneffe Atoll Sustainability Association. “A collaborative project of this magnitude and unique holistic nature has set the baseline for future blue carbon research,” said SERC scientist Hannah Morrissette. “The results from this assessment show how different mangrove ecosystems can be from one another in a relatively small area and highlights their importance to national climate change mitigation goals. ” “Working together with the diverse partners on this project was a magnificent experience,” said Ninon Martinez, Marine Program Manager with University of Belize ’ s Environmental Research Institute. “We all learned a lot from each other, being from different parts of the country and world and all having unique backgrounds in field work, policy, management, science et cetera. This effort segued to several other partnerships and plans for research in Belize, so we hope to keep the momentum going. ” “This first-time comprehensive carbon assessment for Belize ’ s mangrove forests is undeniably significant, advancing both the scientific baseline for mangroves and local research capacity,” said Stacy Baez, senior officer with The Pew Charitable Trusts ’ protecting coastal wetlands and coral reefs campaign. “The project also serves as a science-to-policy model for other countries seeking to include the protection of coastal wetlands into climate policies like the NDC. ” “This country-level carbon stock assessment is essential for providing policy-relevant values that reflect the diversity of mangrove ecosystems found along the coasts and islands of Belize” said Silvestrum Climate Associates coastal ecologist Lisa Beers. The team ’ s work provides a management and monitoring guide for the country ’ s mangroves. “Belize ’ s recently updated NDC calls for enhancement of the capacity of the nation ’ s mangrove ecosystems to act as a carbon sink,” said Nadia Bood, senior program officer, Marine Science and Climate Change with WWF-Mesoamerica. “The World Wildlife Fund was pleased to contribute to the findings from this innovative research for Belize, providing the baseline dataset for not only understanding the country ’ s mangrove storage potential but to be able to track carbon sink over time and scale. ” Other countries may use the model created here to build support for the conservation of blue carbon sinks. The information gained from the Belize Blue Carbon Project will be used to inform Belizean coastal policy and management as conservation activities are increased to protect these invaluable ecosystems and reach climate targets.

The India Mangroves Coalition is the first of its kind industry-led platform under CII's India Business & Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI), that will support and propagate greater mangrove conservation and plantation across India's vast coastline through a multi-stakeholder approach, based on its importance as a Blue Carbon system. * The India Mangroves Coalition will act as a catalyst for actions towards greater mangrove conservation * It will provide a platform to bring all stakeholders to nurture and protect these Blue Carbon ecosystems Coastal forests like mangroves are emerging as a key solution to alleviate the problem of accelerating global warming and other adverse climate events like increased storm and cyclonic activity across the globe that are impacting lives and livelihoods. Dubbed ""Blue Carbon"" systems for their greater ability to absorb carbon, mangrove forests have been proven to not only store up to five times as much carbon as terrestrial forests, but also sequester or trap the carbon for much longer periods of time of up to thousands of years. Blue carbon systems like mangroves will have to play a bigger role in carbon absorption if the world must meet its goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050. Dr. Ravi Singh, Director, WWF India, believes that the consortium will be an effective way to achieve larger objectives related to mitigating climate change. The Coalition aims to bring the latest scientific and technological developments to the fore by engaging with experts from government, academia and other organisations focused on climate change to provide insights and help members adopt leading-edge techniques to further mangrove conservation. Godrej & Boyce said it has been a pioneer in balancing industrial growth alongside conservation of nature since 1940. The Soonabai Pirojsha Godrej Foundation was founded in 1985 to formalize efforts towards the conservation of a stretch of Mumbai's mangroves ecosystem from Vikhroli along the west bank of the Thane creek. The Soonabai Pirojsha Godrej Marine Ecology Centre was also founded in 1985 with eminent founder members like the late Dr. Salim Ali renowned ornithologist, A.K. Ganguly renowned botanist and Dr. Homi Bhabha renowned scientist to focus further efforts on conservation of the surrounding marine ecosystem under the mangrove cover. The mangroves protected by G&B and the Godrej foundations are India's first ISO 14001 certified forest in 1997. This certification has ensured time bound, measurable performance indicators and targets for conservation initiatives. To ensure dedicated focus to the issues, Godrej & Boyce has established a dedicated Wetlands Management Services (WMS) organisation with skilled professionals and has been undertaking significant conservation and renewal initiatives with a three-pronged strategy of promoting academic research, driving conservation and building awareness about the importance of these Blue Carbon systems. Working with multiple stakeholders the WMS team has engaged with almost 60,000 individuals living in coastal areas in the last six years through on-site and off-site programs using a dedicated mangroves mobile app, online webinars, story books, poster exhibitions and has released a mangrove quiz in Marathi on www.mangroves.godrej.com in its efforts to increase awareness through outreach in regional languages. The Soonabai Pirojsha Godrej Foundation has also planned and implemented additional mangrove plantation of approximately 80 acres at its southern border for the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. This was the first of its kind successful public-private partnership for large-scale mangrove plantation in India. Mangroves Sequester 4 Times More Carbon Mangroves are the only ""triple win"" solution: they protect humans from natural calamities, can sequester four times more carbon than rainforests, and sustain the livelihoods of artisanal fishing communities. Mangroves also break down complex pollutants into nutrients and use these for their growth thereby reducing pollution levels. Their dense root network act as natural filters for chemical pollutants to reduce water pollution. Mangroves are one of only three marine ecosystems-alongside saltmarsh and seagrass-currently recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as methodologies that can make measurable contributions to help a country reduce its emissions. In total around 33 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (about three-quarters of the world's emissions in 2019) are locked away in the planet's blue-carbon sinks. Mangrove ecosystems are currently being lost at estimated rates of about 0.6 percent per year, down from previous loss rates of around 1 to 2 percent per year.

40,"Jakarta, Jan. 24 -- The Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) Ministry will step up efforts to conserve seagrass and mangroves as part of the government's strategy to tackle climate change and improve blue carbon potential. ""(The development of) Indonesia's other blue carbon ecosystem (apart from mangroves), namely seagrasses, which has (cover) an estimated area of 1.8 million hectares, has not received much attention so far,"" director general of sea spatial management of the ministry Victor Gustaaf Manoppo observed. He made the statement during a workshop on the ""Blue Carbon Strategy for Achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Targets and Implementation of Carbon Economic Values (NEK)"" on Tuesday. The seagrass ecosystem in Indonesia can absorb up to 790 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), with a projected economic value of US$35 billion, he informed. Meanwhile, Indonesia's mangrove ecosystem, which covers an area of around 3.36 million hectares, is expected to absorb 11 billion tons of CO2 with an estimated economic value of US$66 billion. Furthermore, as part of the implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation attempts in the marine sector, the KKP Ministry is seeking to expand marine conservation areas by 30 percent in 2045. According to the ministry's data, in 2022, Indonesia's marine conservation area only reached 28.9 million hectares, or 8.7 percent of the total area of the nation. ""By expanding the (conservation) ecosystem area to 30 percent, the seagrass and mangrove ecosystems in the conservation area will be able to absorb around 188 million tons of CO2 equivalent,"" Manoppo highlighted. Other efforts that will be carried out by the ministry to mitigate climate change will cover coastal and small islands management as well as marine area utilization arrangement. Blue carbon is carbon that is absorbed and stored in sea and coastal ecosystems. Biomass like leaves, roots, and trunks, as well as mangrove sediment and seagrass meadows can store four to five times more carbon than forests on land. Indonesia has shown its serious commitment to nurturing mangrove forests through their reforestation and restoration since 2010. In 2020, coastal ecosystem protection also became a strategic step in the process of national economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic through the implementation of a labor-intensive activity of mangrove planting in 34 provinces across Indonesia.

41,"In a bid to protect coastal communities from climate change and encourage investment, African nations are increasingly turning to mangrove restoration projects, with Mozambique becoming the latest addition to the growing list of countries with large scale mangrove initiatives. Mozambique follows efforts across the continent - including in Kenya, Madagascar, Gambia and Senegal - and is touted as the world's largest coastal or marine ecosystem carbon storage project. Known as blue carbon, carbon captured by these ecosystems can sequester, or remove, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a faster rate than forests, despite being smaller in size. Mozambique's mangrove restoration project - announced in February alongside its UAE-based partner Blue Forest Solutions - hopes to turn 185,000 hectares (457,100 acres) in the central Zambezia and southern Sofala provinces into a forest which could capture up to 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide, according to project leaders. ""Blue carbon can be utilized not only to sequester tons of carbon dioxide but to also improve the lives of coastal communities,"" Vahid Fotuhi, the Chief Executive officer of Blue Forest, told the Associated Press. ""There are around one million hectares of mangroves forests in Africa. Collectively they're able to sequester more carbon dioxide than the total annual emissions of a country like Croatia or Bolivia."" He added these projects would create green jobs and promote biodiversity. Africa's major mangrove forests have been decimated in recent decades due to logging, fish farming, coastal development, and pollution, leading to increased blue carbon emissions and greater exposure of vulnerable coastal communities to flooding and other threats to livelihood. But the continent's growing attention on mangrove restoration can be attributed in part to the successful Mikoko Pamoja project, initiated in 2013 in Kenya's Gazi Bay, which protected 117 hectares (289 acres) of mangrove forest and replanted 4,000 trees annually, spurring other countries to also address their damaged coastal land and recreate its success. Mikoko Pamoja, Swahili for 'mangroves together', centered its efforts around protecting the small communities in Gazi and Makongeni villages from coastal erosion, loss of fish and climate change. It was dubbed the ""world's first blue carbon project"" and earned the community of just 6,000 global fame, accolades, carbon cash and greater living standards. ""Mikoko Pamoja has led to development of projects in the community, including installation of water,"" Iddi Bomani, the village chairperson of the Gazi community, said. ""Everyone has water available in their houses."" ""It especially leads to improved livelihoods through job creation when done by communities,"" Laitani Suleiman, a committee member of the Mikoko Pamoja, added. Several other projects have come to fruition since. In Senegal, 79 million replanted mangrove trees are projected to store 500,000 tons of carbon over the next 20 years. Neighboring Gambia launched its own reforestation effort in 2017, with Madagascar following suit with its own preservation project two years later. Egypt is planning its mangrove restoration project ahead of hosting the United Nations climate conference in November this year. The projects have sparked a clamor for the sale of carbon credits, a type of permit that allows for a certain amount of emissions as remuneration for forest restoration or other carbon offset projects. Gabon was offered a recent pay package of $17 million through the Central African Forest Initiative due to its protection efforts, but complaints persist on the low prices offered to African governments. ""Africa remains excluded from a lot of financing available under climate change,"" Jean Paul Adam, head of the climate division at the Economic Commission for Africa, said, adding that a lack of financing means nations on the continent are unable to build up their resilience to climate change. He added that ""nature-based solutions and advocating for a fair development price of carbon"" would propel the African economy. And the benefits of reforestation can be significant, according to Coral Reef Alliance's Marissa Stein. ""Restoring and protecting our marine habitats plays a key role in maintaining the health of our planet,"" she said, adding that mangroves alone store up to four times more carbon per hectare than tropical rainforests. The Global Mangroves Alliance also estimates that mangroves reduce damages and flood risk for 15 million people and can prevent over $65 billion of property damage each year.

42,"(TNSJou) -- Hokkaido University issued the following news release: Social vulnerabilities of coastal communities and their reliance on blue carbon ecosystem services may be improved by addressing three major factors, according to a study led by Hokkaido University researchers. Ecosystem services (ES) are benefits nature provides to humans. In coastal areas, seagrass meadows and mangroves provide key ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and climate mitigation. The carbon sequestered in coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems is known as blue carbon, and the ecosystems are usually referred to as blue carbon ecosystems. Blue carbon ecosystems are being lost at a high rate in Southeast Asia. This is problematic because local communities living on the coast heavily rely on seagrasses and mangroves for provisioning services such as livelihoods and food security. A team of scientists from Japan and the Philippines, including Dr. T. E. Angela Quiros, Dr. Kenji Sudo and Professor Masahiro Nakaoka of the Field Science Center for Northern Biosphere at Hokkaido University's Akkeshi Marine Station, examined the social vulnerability of fishing communities that rely on blue carbon ecosystems. The Hokkaido University team collaborated with Busuanga-based NGO C3 Philippines and members of the local government, as well as the Busuanga community for the field collections. Their findings, presented at the sixth International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC6) and published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, suggest conservation strategies to manage social vulnerabilities of coastal communities who rely on blue carbon ecosystems. The scientists examined how ten fishing communities on Busuanga Island, Palawan Province, Philippines responded to the loss or degradation of blue carbon ecosystems, namely seagrasses and mangroves. They assessed the ES provision for small-scale fisheries in multiple ways. They performed ecological assessments of seagrass beds, spatial analysis of seagrass and mangroves along the coast, fisher landing surveys, household and key informant interviews. This wealth of data was used to map social vulnerability in 3 criteria: Exposure, or threats to the blue carbon ecosystems; Sensitivity, or the local importance of blue carbon ecosystems; and Adaptive Capacity, the assets available to avoid impacts in the future from the loss of blue carbon ecosystems. Seagrass ecosystems and their fisheries were more vulnerable to loss and degradation than mangrove ecosystems and fisheries as it takes more effort to catch the same amount of fish from seagrass ecosystems compared to mangrove ecosystems. Furthermore, certain seagrass meadows and mangrove forest types were more sensitive as they occupied a smaller area of the coastline and were host to lower species numbers; others had decreased adaptive capacity due to physical isolation and hosting species with slower growth. Socio-economic sensitivity increased in communities with greater reliance on fisheries and tourism income. Communities with low adaptive capacity were mainly composed of fisherfolk with low education levels and high average fishing experience, and thus few alternatives to fishing. Urbanized (Barangay 5, Tagumpay) communities were more vulnerable than rural communities (Borac, Quezon, Turda) due to degraded blue carbon ecosystems, greater population density and threats from tourism and development. Across all communities, adaptive capacity was constrained by the lack of education, but increased with diversified livelihoods and access to information from and initiatives by NGOs and community organizations. ""Our findings show the need to improve access to education, increase NGO activities and the number of organizations around blue carbon ecosystems, and initiate equitable fisheries management for the vulnerable seagrass and mangrove fisheries,"" says Angela Quiros.

44,"THE gazettement of 676ha of mangroves as a permanent forest reserve in Penang recently was a significant move. This piece of news is a beacon of hope for mangrove conservation, not only in Malaysia, but also across Southeast Asia and the tropical region. On Boxing Day in 2004, many areas on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, including Penang, were severely affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami, which was triggered by an underwater earthquake near Aceh in Sumatra. More than 260,000 deaths were reported. The trauma of the disaster is still felt by communities until today, mainly in coastal villages, towns and cities around the Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea and the Straits of Malacca. Since then, efforts to conserve and restore mangroves have been significantly increased. Mangroves are identified as one of the most effective ways to protect tropical coastlines, and tackle local, regional and global environmental and sustainability issues. Mangroves are primarily known as the Blue Carbon ecosystem for the outstanding ability to sequester atmospheric carbon. They are recognised as a key ecosystem in mitigating the effects of climate change. However, awareness of the importance of mangroves is not at the desired level. In fact, mangroves are still being destroyed for short-term socio-economic gain. Mangroves were a central issue at three major Conferences of Parties in November and December. The challenges in the management of mangroves in Malaysia are complex. They often fall through the cracks of state and federal legal jurisdictions Hopefully, the merger of the Energy and Natural Resources Ministry and the Environment and Water Ministry will result in a more cohesive and integrated governance, including in the management and protection of mangroves. Mangroves also require significant attention from the fisheries authorities under the Agriculture and Food Security Ministry, and from the state authorities. This is because they are important habitats for marine life. Malaysia, being one of the biggest mangrove-holding nations in the world, can play a crucial role in championing conservation. It is prudent for us to go the extra mile to protect this signature habitat and ecosystem of the tropics in order to secure the wellbeing of our people and future generations. Dr A.

45," Kiswahili speakers in East Africa have invented a new word, 'hewa kaa,' to describe carbon credit. Hewa kaa is a commodity villagers in Kenya's coastal region are selling to international corporations as monetary incentive for them to reduce their carbon emissions. When asked what business these villagers are in, they say, ""We are selling air."" The villagers are part of Mikoko Pamoja - Swahili for 'mangroves together' - which is a development initiative in the Gazi and Makongeni areas of the south coast of Kenya. This pioneering project promotes the conservation and sustainable use of mangrove resources to achieve three goals: mitigate climate change, conserve biodiversity and enhance community livelihood. Mikoko Pamoja conserves 117 hectares of state-owned mangroves, representing almost 16 per cent of the ecosystem in the Gazi Bay. During the 20 years from 2013 to 2033, the project seeks to protect 107 hectares of natural mangrove forests and conserve 10 hectares of red mangrove plantation that were established in denuded areas in the early 1990s. The carbon benefits from protecting and planting mangroves are substantial because mangroves retain carbon in their biomass and lock it into the marine mud. According to the Equator Initiative, more than 1,500 metric tons of carbon per hectare are stored beneath the mangrove forests, which is more than eight times that of terrestrial forests. As a result of these efforts, Mikoko Pamoja became the first-ever blue carbon initiative in the world that sold carbon credits from mangrove conservation activities for community development, according to the Equator Initiative. With most credit trading projects based on terrestrial ecosystems, going 'blue' includes conservation and restoration of ocean-based carbon sinks, such as mangrove forests. Set up in 2002, the Equator Initiative is a UN-led, multi-sectoral partnership that brings together governments, civil society, academia, business and grassroots organizations to recognize and advance local, nature-based sustainable development solutions for people, nature, and resilient communities. Why mangroves? Mangroves, also called the 'blue forests,' typically grow in the intertidal zone along tropical and subtropical coastlines. About 75 per cent of mangroves worldwide are concentrated in just 15 countries, and barely 7 per cent lie in protected areas, according to Equator Initiative. These trees are essential for both human and marine life. Mangroves: Provide a nursery habitat for much commercial fish and shellfish during their early life stages and contribute to abundance of seafood. Support accumulation of tree debris and bacteria in the water and are an essential food source and refuge for juvenile fish; the knotted mangrove roots protect fish from predators. As such, mangroves help to sustain the fishing industry upon which coastal communities depend for livelihood. Act as a buffer between land and sea. When strong waves turn towards land, mangroves diffuse their force protecting the shoreline and human settlements. This prevents erosion and reduces damage to infrastructure. Protect water quality by removing nutrients and pollutants from storm water runoff before they reach seagrass habitats and coral reefs. Their complex systems also shelter a range of wildlife species, including birds and honeybees. Serve as high-quality carbon sinks, a critical resource for climate change mitigation. The carbon benefits from protecting and planting mangroves are substantial because mangroves retain carbon in their biomass and lock it into the marine mud. According to the Equator Initiative, more than 1,500 metric tons of carbon per hectare are stored beneath the mangrove forests, which is more than eight times that of terrestrial forests. Plan Vivo, an organisation that helps communities plant trees and generate carbon credits, validated Mikoko Pamoja to sell at least 3,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year from 2013 to 2033. This arrangement is expected to generate annual revenue of about $130,000. Forward-thinking businesses buy the credits, NGOs, universities and individuals who are looking to manage their carbon footprints, while supporting people and nature. Mikoko Pamoja has funded pumps, providing clean drinking water for several hundred children in primary schools in Gazi and Makongeni and nearly 5,400 people in the broader community. The project also has helped with the purchase of textbooks, sports uniforms and other learning materials for 700 children. The Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute is working with communities on the mangrove project. Dr. James Mwaluma, a research scientist and oceans and coastal systems expert at the institute, describes the collaboration: ""Not only are we replanting mangroves where others have been cut, we are involving communities in selling carbon credit to the international community."" Dr. Mwaluma speaks highly of the Mikoko Pamoja project whose revenue from selling carbon credit is being ploughed back into the community for building schools and hospitals. Before its launch, access to clean water and education materials in Gazi Bay village was a privilege for the few. The project has seen more than 30 per cent of carbon credit profits in education, clean water supply, mangrove reforestation and equal employment opportunities for the majority of people in Gazi. Mikoko Pamoja has funded pumps, providing clean drinking water for several hundred children in primary schools in Gazi and Makongeni and nearly 5,400 people in the broader community. The project also has helped with the purchase of textbooks, sports uniforms and other learning materials for 700 children. Mikoko Pamoja is one of many community-based projects that are supported by the Kenyan government's Blue Economy strategy that aims to unlock the potential of sea-land opportunities in the coastal region for sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth. It also plans to create employment, while conserving and sustainably using coastal and marine environments. With 640 kilometres of coastline, Kenya is poised to harvest from the Indian Ocean at an industrial scale, benefiting communities along the shore. Some villagers are selling carbon credits to the world market and restoring corals that humans and climate change have damaged, while others are growing and selling crab meat and farming high-value fish. Dr. Mwaluma says that youths in Dabaso, further north on the coastline, benefit from the many programmes the initiative is supporting. 'In Dabaso, young people from this village are involved in growing crabs and producing crab meat that they sell in their own restaurants. Their customers are mainly tourists that visit the northern coastal towns of Watamu and Malindi. They have created a business that generates, on average, $360,000 a year and has pulled them out of a vicious circle of poverty.' Mikoko Pamoja became the first-ever blue carbon initiative in the world to sell carbon credits from mangrove conservation activities for community development, according to the Equator Initiative. With most credit trading projects based on terrestrial ecosystems, going 'blue' includes conservation and restoration of ocean-based carbon sinks, such as mangrove forests. As a flagship project, Mikoko Pamoja's model is being replicated in Vanga Blue Forest, 60 km south of Gazi Bay, close to the border with Tanzania. The expansion in Vanga will effectively triple the area of mangroves protected and the number of carbon credits sold, further increasing revenues. Good science, community buy-in, communal entrepreneurship and government support have been identified as building blocks of the project that could be replicated by other mangrove areas in Africa and Latin America. Since its inception, Mikoko Pamoja participants have consistently shared their experience in the region, exchanging visits with communities in Gambia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Senegal and Tanzania.

46," 9 November 2022 (International Atomic Energy Agency) Absorbing almost a quarter of all human-made carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emitted into the atmosphere each year, the ocean is both a victim of, and a solution to, climate change. On one hand, the excessive CO2 changes its chemistry, leading to ocean acidification, which can have lasting effects on the health of marine organisms and ecosystems. On the other, exactly because of this absorption, the ocean may be one of humanity's key tools in both mitigation and adaptation efforts. This was the focus of yesterday's IAEA event at the #Atoms4Climate Pavilion during the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. In a roundtable discussion, marine science experts discussed the role of the ocean in providing a long term, nature-based solution to reducing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere - through carbon that can be stored long term in the soils and vegetation of marine ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows - known as Blue Carbon. The event covered the need for research and development in the field of Blue Carbon specifically, and the importance of preserving the vegetated coastal ecosystems that remain. Panelist Dr Ana Querios of Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK, said: 'Facing both a climate change emergency and a biodiversity crisis, it is our job to make sure we fully understand the ability of the ocean to help mitigate each of these issues, and to support the development of solutions that protect it.' Each panelist stressed the need for swift action and more in-depth research, as well as the vulnerability of vegetated coastal ecosystems to destruction. Professor Jean-Pierre Gattuso of the CNRS, IDDRI and Sorbonne Université in France, highlighted that while the climactic benefits of coastal Blue Carbon ecosystems are uncertain, 'the conservation and restoration of these ecosystems are nevertheless absolutely essential to maintain or recover the numerous services they provide for coastal protection, food security and biodiversity.' Blue Carbon and carbon sequestration have significant potential to be used strategically as a long term solution to increasing CO2 emissions. However, this requires the exact capacity of Blue Carbon and Blue Carbon habitats to be defined. As part of its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14, which aims to 'conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development,' the IAEA uses nuclear technology and applications to help countries tackle the impacts of climate change. Using natural and artificial radionuclides to measure the rates and origin of sediment accumulation, the IAEA can determine accurate carbon storage rates - known as carbon sequestration - in vegetated coastal areas, allowing policymakers and scientists to determine which Blue Carbon habitats are more efficient carbon sinks. The IAEA is involved in Blue Carbon projects in more than 30 countries to assess the rates of carbon sequestration in vegetated coastal areas and to aid in data collection. On the African continent alone, the IAEA is working with 12 countries to build capacity on Blue Carbon. Through this regional technical cooperation project, the IAEA is training scientists and assists with the establishment of laboratories with the capability to accurately measure carbon sequestration rates. 'At the IAEA's Marine Environment Laboratories in Monaco, we are investigating the potential of coastal vegetative ecosystems as natural climate solutions to increase the drawdown of CO2 from the atmosphere and long-term storage of CO2 in the sediment,' said Jana Friedrich, Head of the IAEA Radioecology Laboratory. Why Blue Carbon? Professor Carlos M. Duarte of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, emphasized the varied benefits of Blue Carbon. 'Carbon removal using Blue Carbon ecosystems is cost effective, safe and generates a wealth of co-benefits aiding in the adaptation of the receiving communities,' he said. Blue Carbon is stored in both coastal and open marine ecosystems. It refers to the process by which healthy vegetated ecosystems take up, or absorb, carbon, reducing the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. At the same time, mangrove forests for example, serve as coastal protection against sea level rise and extreme events. Ocean carbon sequestration is of particular interest, as unlike land-based forms of carbon sequestration, Blue Carbon ecosystems can bury carbon in sediment for long periods of time, sometimes centuries or even millennia. It is for this reason that Blue Carbon ecosystems, specifically ecosystems that accumulate sediment, are of such relevance in efforts to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. In addition to their utility of taking up carbon, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests and salt marshes, for example, all act as stabilizers, and thereby keep sediment from being disturbed. Once carbon is sequestered, therefore, it will remain there, avoiding the remineralization of carbon and the subsequent release of CO2. This is why preserving and protecting these ecosystems is so critical - the CO2 they are sequestering would be released if the sediment is disturbed.

47,"Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav chaired today the 1st General Body Meeting of National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) an institute under Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change(MoEF&CC). He emphasized that Prime Minister accords huge importance to Blue Economy with focus on sustainable and climate resilient coastal infrastructure and livelihoods of coastal communities. Shri Yadav said Government is steering ahead with marine spatial planning (MSP) to develop a blueprint for area-based management with multiple management objectives. The Minister also directed NCSCM to contribute to Mission MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats and Tangible Incomes) for mangrove conservation with focus on tangible income to coastal communities. NCSCM was established in February 2011, as a research institution to support the protection, conservation, restoration, management, and policy advice on coasts. The vision of NCSCM is to promote sustainable coasts through increased partnerships, conservation practices, scientific research, and knowledge management for the benefit and wellbeing of current and future generations. The National Centre has undertaken several landmark research studies such as mapping of over 34,000 sq. km. of the Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA), mapping of composite hazard line, preparation of the Coastal Zone Management Plans as per the Coastal Regulation Zone(CRZ) Notifications, 2011 and 2019, cumulative coastal environmental impact assessment, ecosystem goods and services, blue carbon sequestration, ecosystem health report cards among others.

48,"India, March 31 -- An alarming 50 per cent of the world's mangrove forests have disappeared in the last five decades due to coastal developments Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a new initiative for planting mangroves along the coastlines and on saltpans of India in her Budget speech this year. The Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats and Tangible Incomes (MISHTI) comes after India joined the Mangrove Alliance for Climate, launched during the 27th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Egypt in November 2022. Also read: Budget 2023-24: Experts hail Centre's mangrove restoration scheme but stress on scientific implementation An alarming 50 per cent of the world's mangrove forests have disappeared in the last five decades due to coastal developments, including climate change, logging and agriculture, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature . Present in the lowlands of intertidal zones in most tropical and sub-tropical countries, mangroves act as the first line of defence during cyclones by preventing large-scale structural, ecological and livelihood damages. They are particularly efficient in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and are home to vital species in the blue carbon ecosystem and help prevent coastal erosion. The Sundarbans, which cover 60 per cent of the area in Bangladesh and the remaining in West Bengal, are the largest continuous tracts of mangroves in the world. Some three per cent of the mangroves in the world are found in India, accounting for more than 43-45 mangrove species, with the Sundarbans having the most area covered by them. Climate change has caused the Sundarbans to experience a rise in sea levels and a decrease in salinity, which has changed the composition and hydrology of mangrove species, rendering further planting of mangroves along the coast ineffective (survival rate of less than 70 per cent). Also read: Climate change: Why we can't rely on regrowing coastal habitats to offset carbon emissions Mangroves are regarded as great sinks for carbon sequestration. In the case of mangroves, above-ground and below-ground biomass needs to be calculated to evaluate the amount of carbon sequestered. Mangroves in India In the Indian context, regional evaluation across the carbon stocks has not been done. More importantly, carbon sequestration results from the constant addition of organic material into the soil, which is kept intact with the entwining of mangrove roots and their pneumatophores. Incidentally, these are where most plastic wastes accumulate and can lead to the suffocation of these roots. Having tackled several such climate disasters in the past, Rotary Clubs in India closely work at district and state levels to build climate resilience. An analysis of a successful mangrove restoration model in Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science journal highlights two case studies, one in the urban coastal port of Mundra in Gujarat's Kachchh district and the second in a coastal rural area in Surat district. The two case studies indicate that concerted efforts and collaboration between government agencies, local communities and the private sector could pave the way for mangrove restoration in India. India is on course to devise a unique biodiversity conservation model through a holistic approach. The government has rolled out the MISHTI scheme as part of this effort. Climate change-induced sea level rise, tornadoes and cyclones have been impacting the lives and livelihoods of communities living around coastal ecosystems. Mangroves are considered the best defenders of tropical coastal communities that suffer the most during such disasters. Rotary Clubs in India encourage their members across the world to restore mangroves on a war footing. In India, they have been creating Miyawaki forests in various states. But it takes at least 40 years for these forests to sequester carbon. On the other hand, restoring mangroves will yield result in three years. Also read: Plant 50 million mangroves in the Sundarbans? Improbable, say experts It is more effective to restore existing mangrove habitats than to begin planting and establishing nurseries on newly constructed islands and along the shore. Protecting the present mangrove cover on the property increases the likelihood of preserving carbon sequestration. Science tells us that if we are to prevent a climate catastrophe, planned efforts are required to save the planet. We can bring changes by applying the Sundarbans model to Odisha, Kutch, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. There is hope that things can change if we all work together to save the environment. It's not too late to slow the pace of climate change as long as we act today.

49,"The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK) has said that a study on preparing a blue carbon ecosystem and integrating marine ecosystems have an important role in climate change mitigation efforts. Marine ecosystems, which include mangrove forests, seagrass beds, brackish water, saltwater swamps, and coral reefs, have great potential as carbon sinks and stores, Minister of Environment and Forestry Siti Nurbaya Bakar noted. ""On the basis of an ecosystem base, the study sections are very relevant to the FOLU Net Sink 2030 Agenda, which is our determination as a nation,"" she said at a seminar on blue carbon ecosystems at Manggala Wanabakti Building in Jakarta on Monday. The implementation of blue carbon ecosystems offers significant development opportunities but also poses challenges for several sectors, such as sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, marine and coastal tourism, and coastal development. Thus, regulatory support, incentives, research, and capacity building, including financing mechanisms, are needed to support investment for healthy and sustainable oceans, while ensuring such investment is in accordance with the sustainable and resilient marine economy concept, Bakar said. According to her, this is in line with the records of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry that there are several issues related to coastal and marine ecosystems that need attention and their resolution will require institutional follow-up. The study also covers important issues regarding building institutional capacity at a very broad level. ""In my point of view, this is what will guide our governance regarding ecosystem-based carbon (footprint), said Nurbaya. She informed that the government has proposed directives in this regard, which cover regulations, institutions, processes, systems and procedures, community participation, financing systems, databases, policy exercise, and policy-making as well as national (central government) and sub-national (community, private, regional government) interactions, especially how coercive and cooperative patterns can be built and maintained well in relation to carbon. This is in terms of roles, pressures, inter-agency mandates, control, implementation assumptions, sources of policy innovation, and implementation emphasis toward carbon governance. Bakar further said that her party appreciates the initial efforts made by the Indonesia Ocean Justice Initiative (IOJI) to study blue economy ecosystems in Indonesia. She expressed the hope that the study would support Indonesia's efforts toward and progress made in carbon governance. ""I am also optimistic about the marine and wetland sectors where, in the context of wetlands as ecosystems, the relevance of working with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry is very close,"" she added. Meanwhile, Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Sakti Wahyu Trenggono said that Indonesia's mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, which cover an area of 3.36 million hectares, could potentially absorb 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide with an estimated economic value of US$66 billion. The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries has implemented five policies related to the blue economy, which comprise the expansion of marine conservation areas; quota-based measurable capture fisheries; development of environmentally friendly marine, coastal, and inland aquaculture; management of coasts and small islands; and management of plastic waste in the sea. ""We are very focused on ecology because if the sea is damaged, then the blue economy or the ecology will also be damaged and blue carbon will not be obtained,"" Trenggono added.

50,"The Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) Ministry will step up efforts to conserve seagrass and mangroves as part of the government's strategy to tackle climate change and improve blue carbon potential. ""(The development of) Indonesia's other blue carbon ecosystem (apart from mangroves), namely seagrasses, which has (cover) an estimated area of 1.8 million hectares, has not received much attention so far,"" director general of sea spatial management of the ministry Victor Gustaaf Manoppo observed. He made the statement during a workshop on the Blue Carbon Strategy for Achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Targets and Implementation of Carbon Economic Values (NEK) on Tuesday. The seagrass ecosystem in Indonesia can absorb up to 790 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), with a projected economic value of US$35 billion, he informed. Meanwhile, Indonesia's mangrove ecosystem, which covers an area of around 3.36 million hectares, is expected to absorb 11 billion tons of CO2 with an estimated economic value of US$66 billion. Furthermore, as part of the implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation attempts in the marine sector, the KKP Ministry is seeking to expand marine conservation areas by 30 percent in 2045. According to the ministry's data, in 2022, Indonesia's marine conservation area only reached 28.9 million hectares, or 8.7 percent of the total area of the nation. ""By expanding the (conservation) ecosystem area to 30 percent, the seagrass and mangrove ecosystems in the conservation area will be able to absorb around 188 million tons of CO2 equivalent,"" Manoppo highlighted. Other efforts that will be carried out by the ministry to mitigate climate change will cover coastal and small islands management as well as marine area utilization arrangement. Blue carbon is carbon that is absorbed and stored in sea and coastal ecosystems. Biomass like leaves, roots, and trunks, as well as mangrove sediment and seagrass meadows can store four to five times more carbon than forests on land. Indonesia has shown its serious commitment to nurturing mangrove forests through their reforestation and restoration since 2010. In 2020, coastal ecosystem protection also became a strategic step in the process of national economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic through the implementation of a labor-intensive activity of mangrove planting in 34 provinces across Indonesia.

51,"The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) is collaborating with Seychelles, a country in the Indian Ocean region, to broaden the scope of knowledge regarding blue carbon to support a blue economy. ""It aims to strengthen the blue economy and provide additional knowledge on Blue Carbon, Blue Bond, and Marine Protected Areas,"" Head of the Maritime and Fisheries Research and Human Resources Agency (BRSDM) I Nyoman Radiarta said in a written statement here on Saturday. ""The collaboration is also to emphasize the importance of sustainable management of marine and fishery resources,"" he further stated. Radiarta remarked that for implementing this collaboration, the Training on Trainers (ToT) on the Blue Economy Program was held and was attended by 700 participants in a hybrid format. This activity is a series of collaborations between the ministry and the Seychelles that had been initiated since 2021. He expressed optimism that this activity would be able to raise public awareness on the importance of sustainable management of fisheries resources by applying the blue economy concept and developing creativity and innovation. Radiarta explained that the collaboration aims to ensure the sustainability of fisheries ecosystems in Indonesia and encourage equitable economic distribution in coastal areas. Collaboration is also aimed at boosting the competitiveness of fishery products in the global market and can be a solution to climate issues by maintaining the blue carbon ecosystem. Blue carbon is a reserve of emissions absorbed, stored, and released by coastal and marine ecosystems In Indonesia, Blue Carbon is spread in coastal ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and peatlands in coastal areas.

52,"Mangrove forests have huge blue carbon potential in terms of both aboveground and belowground biomass, according to the Environment and Forestry Ministry. Blue carbon can potentially accelerate Indonesia's efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions, a commitment that has been outlined in the nationally determined contributions (NDC) document, director general of sustainable forest management at the ministry, Agus Justianto, explained here on Friday. ""Coastal ecosystem development and mangrove restoration are among the adaption and mitigation efforts against climate change for supporting the target of reducing greenhouse emissions,"" he said during a discussion on mangrove restoration as a solution to national climate change. Blue carbon is carbon that is absorbed and stored in sea and coastal ecosystems. Biomass like leaves, roots, and trunks, as well as mangrove sediment and seagrass meadows, can store four to five times more carbon than forests on land. Justianto said that blue carbon that is stored for long periods is different from green carbon stored in forests for many years. According to him, climate change mitigation can be made more effective if green carbon development on land forests can be followed by blue carbon development and utilization. Since 2010, Indonesia has shown its serious commitment to nurturing mangrove forests through reforestation and restoration. In 2020, coastal ecosystem protection became a strategic step in the recovery process from the COVID-19 pandemic through the organization of a labor-intensive activity of mangrove planting in 34 provinces across Indonesia. ""The labor-intensive program can increase the local economy during the pandemic. The movement of mangrove reforestation is carried out involving all aspects of the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private parties through the corporate social responsibility (CSR) program at the central and regional levels,"" he explained.

53,"JAKARTA, April 18 -- Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Government of Indonesia issued the following news release: Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Sakti Wahyu Trenggono revealed the blue economy strategy implemented by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) to improve marine health in order to curb climate change, and accelerate sustainable marine-based economic development. The strategy is in the form of strengthening the blue carbon ecosystem by expanding and strictly maintaining conservation areas for mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. Then implement a quota-based measurable fishing policy, develop sustainable aquaculture, as well as structuring the use of marine space and small islands that prioritizes ecosystem protection. ""We are currently faced with a situation where we have to protect nature along with an economy that must continue to grow. Oceans and coastal ecosystems have an important function in controlling climate change and improving people's welfare,"" explained Minister Trenggono at the Blue Carbon Workshop on Blue Economy Development and Achievement of NDC Targets in Jakarta, Monday (18/4/2022). This strategy is a tangible form of the KKP's commitment to protecting marine and coastal ecosystems that contribute significantly to climate change solutions and mitigation. In addition, the sea has a strategic role as a source of world food, transportation routes, and for economic activities. Based on the data, Indonesia has an important role in mitigating climate change from the blue carbon aspect because it has a mangrove ecosystem of 3.36 million hectares and seagrass beds covering an area of 3 million hectares which has the potential of up to 17 percent as the world's blue carbon reserves. ""The ability of blue carbon is often said to be greater than the same ability of terrestrial vegetation, or green carbon,"" added Minister Trenggono. To make this strategy a success, Minister Trenggono hopes to strengthen synergies with various parties, including the Ministry of Environment (KLHK) and Forestry. He revealed the current joint discussion in terms of restoring the mangrove ecosystem and continuing to expand the conservation area. ""We are together with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry to make breakthroughs to protect the marine environment which is believed to be greater in the absorption of carbon emissions can always be maintained,"" he said. Minister Trenggono hopes that in the future, with the application of the blue economy principle, marine ecosystems can be maintained in the long term so as to create jobs that can improve the welfare of coastal communities and strengthen the national economy.

54,"The Environment and Forestry Ministry drew attention to the importance of conservation to control climate change through the marine and coastal sectors. ""It should be noted that efforts to control climate change from the marine and coastal sectors is highly dependent on coastal and marine conservation itself,"" Director General of Climate Change Control (PPI) Laksmi Dwanthi stated during a virtual discussion on blue carbon here on Wednesday. It is since coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses, can store and produce carbon or better known as blue carbon. Blue carbon is currently considered as an important ecosystem since it can absorb greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the forestry, energy, agriculture, and industry sectors are being prioritized to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the potential for carbon sequestration and storage in the mangrove ecosystem will also be taken into account based on its ability to store carbon. ""The marine sector, including blue carbon, has actually been included in the calculation, especially mangroves or soils in mangroves. We will continue to look for other potential mangrove ecosystems that can absorb carbon,"" she affirmed. Dwanthi explained that Indonesia continued to ensure a vision related to marine and climate change, along with other archipelagic countries in the world on account of the blue carbon potential. Indonesia has vast blue carbon potential on account of the presence of about 3.3 million hectares of mangroves that can store 950 tCO2e of carbon per hectare and about three million hectares of seagrass beds that can store 119.5 tCO2e of carbon per hectare.

55,"The Environment and Forestry Ministry invites business actors to contribute to mangrove forest restoration and conservation as one of the attempts to mitigate the impacts of climate change in Indonesia. ""Protecting mangroves as a blue carbon ecosystem does not only aim to reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration but also to preserve healthy mangroves that can provide benefits for the community's welfare,"" Director General of Sustainable Forest Management at the ministry Agus Justianto noted in a press release on Tuesday. The ministry estimated that the forestry and other land use sector in Indonesia will be able to absorb around 113.18 gigatons of carbon, with 33 billion tons absorbed by mangrove forests, 55 billion tons by peatlands, and 25.18 billion tons by tropical forests. In addition, Indonesia's carbon trade potential is projected to reach Rp350 trillion. Mangrove ecosystems have a quite high blue carbon value and play a major role in achieving the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, so their restoration must be supported by all parties. The director general assessed that restoration attempts are important to bolster the resilience of Indonesia's coastal areas to face various environmental problems. Marine resource and ecosystem management aims to overcome natural resource degradation, climate change and marine pollution, as well as socio-economic vulnerability of coastal communities,"" he remarked. Indonesia has the largest mangrove forest area in the world. According to the One Map Mangrove Indonesia, the total area of the country's mangrove forests reaches 3.3 million hectares, or equivalent to 20 percent of the total area of mangrove forests in the world. Deputy Head for Environment and Forestry at the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) Silverus Oscar Unggul said his side had encouraged business players to collaborate to restore mangroves in Indonesia. Several business players, such as state-run oil and gas company PT Pertamina (Persero), state-owned electricity provider PT PLN (Persero), state-run tin mining corporation PT Timah, as well as private-owned energy company PT Indika Energy, have actively contributed to the preservation of mangrove ecosystems through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs. ""Protecting, developing, and preserving mangrove forests can be conducted well if all stakeholders work hand-in-hand and are committed to realizing successful sustainable mangrove restoration,"" Unggul added.

56,"Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) Ministry introduced three blue economy strategies and action plans at the G20 event based on ecological and economic considerations in marine space activities for healthy, safe, resilient, and productive seas. Director General of Marine Spatial Management at the KKP Victor Gustaaf Manoppo explained that the strategy aimed at expanding conservation areas, with a target of 30 percent of the total area of Indonesian waters, and manage marine debris and spatial planning of marine, coastal, and small islands that could protect coastal resources and small islands from damage caused by economic activities. ""The first strategy is the expansion of marine conservation areas that are closely related to climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. Indonesia has 28.4 million hectares of a conservation area that protects coastal ecosystems that are important for climate resilience,"" Manoppo noted in an official release on Tuesday. He reminded that currently, the existing conservation areas protected about three percent, or about 88 thousand hectares of Indonesian mangrove ecosystems and 34 percent, or around 50 thousand hectares of Indonesian seagrass beds. Speaking in connection with strategies related to marine waste management, he affirmed that marine plastic waste posed a considerable risk to oceans. Based on data from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) in 2018, it was estimated that 0.27-0.59 million tons per year of marine debris polluted the sea in 2018. In line with the blue economy strategy, Indonesia recently launched the 'Month of Love of the Sea' program. The idea is to encourage and empower fishermen to be involved in protecting the sea from marine pollution by providing incentives from the garbage collected from the sea. This is expected to reduce marine debris by up to 70 percent,"" Manoppo explained. Meanwhile, the third strategy is the sustainable management of marine, coastal, and small islands that is conducted through strengthening regulations for the protection of blue carbon reserve areas, allocating space to maintain and increase blue carbon stocks, and improving management synergy and the quality of blue carbon stock areas, he stated. Manoppo also noted that in order to protect the ecosystem, several spatial regulations and permits were set to ensure that the ecosystem was protected and not converted for other land uses. He stated that 15 locations were designed as special areas for environmental control in the form of blue carbon reserves and placing all mangrove restoration areas under the coastal ecosystem management zone. Currently, more than 20 provinces are in the process of including coastal management areas in the integration of local spatial planning. Moreover, several regulations have been issued to ensure that blue carbon ecosystems outside marine protected areas are also sustainably protected. ""Indonesia invites the G20 global partnership to actively participate and become involved in building capacity and promoting cooperation on the maritime and climate agenda,"" he noted. Earlier, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, emphasized that Indonesia's Presidency in G20 ensured an accelerated transition to renewable energy and maintained the sustainability of the oceans. Hartarto also believes that the estimated annual value of the blue economy of US$2.5 trillion will be able to attract investors, insurance, banks, and policy makers as the new sources of wealth. ""The challenge we are facing right now is to expand sustainability, and this will require the private sector to participate,"" he stated.

57,"The World Banks Board of Executive Directors approved a project to support the Government of Indonesia in enhancing the management of mangroves and livelihoods of local communities on May 20, 2022. The Mangroves for Coastal Resilience Project will focus on strengthening the policy and institutions for mangrove management and rehabilitation, promoting sustainable mangrove management, as well as improving the livelihood opportunities for Indonesian coastal communities living around mangrove forests in selected areas. The success of this project will contribute significantly to achieving Indonesias emissions reduction target under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), as well as our target to turn forests and land use sector into a Net Sink by 2030. Mangroves restoration and conservation are critical to realize those targets and are testament to Indonesias strong global commitment to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, conveyed Siti Nurbaya Bakar, Minister of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia. Spanning about 3.4 million hectares, Indonesias mangroves account for over 20 percent of the global mangrove area and cover 40 of the 54 species of true mangroves currently recorded as the richest diversity in the world. Indonesias mangroves store 3.14 billion tons of CO2 (commonly referred to as blue carbon) or equivalent to GHG emissions from approximately 2.5 billion passenger vehicles driven for one year. Mangroves are a key component of livelihoods in coastal communities, providing important sources of food and income. About fifty-five percent of the total fish catch biomass in Indonesia consists of mangrove-dependent species, the total annual production of which is valued at US$825 million. Mangroves also have tourism value of almost US$30 million a year. Recent World Bank research suggests that mangroves have annual values from US$15,000 to almost US$50,000 per hectare in Indonesia. Given their significant value, Indonesian mangroves need to be rehabilitated. In the last 20 years, Indonesia lost approximately 13,000 hectares of mangroves every year (larger than the size of Paris), driven by indirect factors including global demand for products such as shrimp (which is often cultivated in areas which were mangrove before) as well as overall lack of perceived mangroves economic value. Coastal communities that depend on mangroves for their resilience and livelihoods are among the most vulnerable in Indonesia. They have limited access to services such as secondary schools, safe water, electricity, and transportation, and experience 1.27 percent higher poverty rate compared to communities living in non-coastal villages. Now with an extended COVID-19 imposed crisis, poverty rates are likely to increase emphasizing the need for targeted policies and investments to reach these coastal communities. We commend the bold steps taken by the Government of Indonesia to reverse mangrove losses and rehabilitate both degraded and deforested mangrove areas, and therefore stand to support those efforts. Conservation of Indonesias healthy mangroves ecosystems and targeted rehabilitation using global best practices brings significant economic returns to the country in the forms of coastal resilience, fisheries productivity, tourism potential and climate mitigation. Through the project, the World Bank supports the country in promoting green, resilient, and inclusive development among coastal communities, including by strengthening national and sub-national institutions and policies managing mangroves and adding value to mangroves by enabling future payments for blue carbon contained in mangroves., stated Satu Kahkonen, World Bank Country Director for Indonesia and Timor-Leste. By integrating sustainable resource management into village-level planning and increasing the role of women in mangrove management and village leadership, we expect to witness increased mangrove cover and reduce mangrove loss. The project is designed to support the Governments National Mangrove Rehabilitation program that aims to rehabilitate 600,000 hectares of mangroves by 2024. Initially focused on four provinces that contain a significant portion of existing and degraded mangroves areas, namely East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, North Sumatra and Riau, the integrated conservation, rehabilitation and livelihood improvement model can be replicated throughout the country. The project is also supportive of the World Bank Groups Climate Action Plan (FY 2021-25) and Gender Strategy (FY 2016-23), particularly the strategic objectives related to economic opportunities and enhancing womens voice and agency.

58,"The Indonesian government has set an ambitious target of restoring 600 thousand hectares of mangrove forests across the country by 2024. The world's largest archipelagic country sees the preservation of mangrove forests as crucial because of their role in providing habitats for aquatic and terrestrial fauna and flora, protection from strong winds and waves, soil stabilization and erosion prevention, nutrient retention and water quality improvement through filtration of sediments and pollutants, flood mitigation, sequestration of carbon dioxide, and protection of associated marine ecosystems. As high carbon storage ecosystems, mangrove and peatland ecosystems play a strategic role as nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Peatlands and mangroves store up to 2 to 10 times more carbon than forests. Given the significant role of mangrove and peatland ecosystems, the government has recently converted the Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) into Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM). Mangroves, however, have been disappearing more quickly than inland tropical rainforests, particularly due to clear-cutting for shrimp farms. The loss of mangroves has led to a decline in fisheries, degradation of clean water supply, salinization of coastal soils, erosion and land subsidence, as well as an increase in gas emissions, among other things. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), while visiting Tana Tidung district, North Kalimantan province, on October 19, 2021 had revealed that the country's existing mangrove forests covered a total area of 3.6 million hectares. Rehabilitation efforts are being undertaken to protect coastal areas from sea waves, seawater intrusion, and preserve the habitat of species, including birds, fishes, crabs, monkeys, and other flora and fauna, living in and around the mangrove forests, according to him. Accompanied by several foreign ambassadors, Widodo planted mangrove trees in North Kalimantan as part of the mangrove restoration program. The program's funds were derived from various sources, including state and regional budgets, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs of private and state-owned companies, and the community in general, he noted. Earlier, the President had called on regional governments to take a cue from the model of mangrove rehabilitation at Bali's Ngurah Rai Forest Park. Accompanied by the Minister of Environment and Forestry, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, he, on October 8, 2021, visited the forest park to review the implementation of mangrove planting activities. ""We will continue to do this in coastal areas to restore and preserve our mangrove forest areas and also to anticipate and mitigate impacts of global climate change,"" he remarked. The Ngurah Rai Forest Park, which was developed in 2003, is a pilot project for mangrove rehabilitation efforts that combines education and tourism. The park is administratively located in Tanjung Benoa and its surroundings in Kuta and South Kuta sub-districts, Badung district (covering an area of 627 hectares), and in Serangan Island, South Denpasar sub-district, Denpasar city (spanning an area of 746.50 hectares). The mangrove park has abundant natural beauty and biodiversity including bird species, and aquatic species, such as fish, mollusks, and shrimps. The government has emphasized that efforts to control the effects of climate change in the marine and coastal sectors are highly dependent on coastal and marine conservation since coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses, can store and produce carbon, which is better known as blue carbon. Blue carbon is currently considered an important ecosystem since it can absorb greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, Indonesia has vast blue carbon potential on account of the presence of about 3.3 million hectares of mangroves that can store 950 tCO2e of carbon per hectare and about three million hectares of seagrass beds that can store 119.5 tCO2e of carbon per hectare. Hence, the Environment and Forestry Ministry is continuing to encourage the inclusion of blue carbon in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) document considering its potential to store carbon, according to the ministry's director general of climate change control, Laksmi Dwanthi. NDC is an emission reduction contribution document that reflects the commitment of each state party in the Paris Agreement, she explained. Indonesia's blue carbon potential can be found in its large marine area, which contains 23 percent of the world's mangroves ecosystem, she noted. ""It is a very significant area related to the potential carbon absorption, not only in Indonesia but also at the global level,"" she said. Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya as well as Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono have held discussions with experts on assessing how far Indonesia can include the blue carbon potential in the context of climate change mitigation, she added. In the context of adaptation, the ministry has taken various steps and programs to make the policy mainstream, especially in coastal areas, for instance by implementing the Climate Village Program, she informed. In addition, Indonesia has cooperated with other archipelagic countries--Fiji and Costa Rica--to submit a proposal to integrate marine aspects in climate change issues at the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in 2019, she added. Minister Nurbaya Bakar launched the 2021 National Mangrove Map on October 13, 2021 for the preservation of the country's mangrove forest area. The latest data from the National Mangrove Map shows that Indonesia has 3,364,080 hectares of mangroves, an increase of 52,873 hectares from 3,311,207 hectares in 2013-2019. In the 3,364,080 hectares of mangrove land, there are variations in canopy classification from good to sparse, the minister said. Concerning mangrove lands with sparse canopy to damaged canopy, the government is targeting to recover around 600 thousand hectares by 2024, she added. Nurbaya reaffirmed the government's commitment to mangrove preservation efforts by successfully transforming fishponds into mangrove ecosystems again. As for the 2021 mangrove rehabilitation program's target of restoring 34 thousand hectares of mangroves, the BRGM is upbeat that it can be achieved. Head of BRGM, Hartono, said that the agency will continue to plant mangroves in nine provinces: North Sumatra, Bangka Belitung, Riau Islands, Riau, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, Papua, and West Papua. ""In order to expedite mangrove rehabilitation, we are also involving local residents through the labor-intensive method, so that the mangrove planting target can quickly be achieved,"" he informed. The government hopes that the program will benefit people by improving their standard of living and purchasing power, thus making them prosperous. In addition, the program is also expected to support efforts to accelerate economic recovery post-COVID-19.

59,"Jakarta, Feb. 11 -- The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) is collaborating with Seychelles, a country in the Indian Ocean region, to broaden the scope of knowledge regarding blue carbon to support a blue economy. ""It aims to strengthen the blue economy and provide additional knowledge on Blue Carbon, Blue Bond, and Marine Protected Areas,"" Head of the Maritime and Fisheries Research and Human Resources Agency (BRSDM) I Nyoman Radiarta said in a written statement here on Saturday. ""The collaboration is also to emphasize the importance of sustainable management of marine and fishery resources,"" he further stated. Radiarta remarked that for implementing this collaboration, the Training on Trainers (ToT) on the Blue Economy Program was held and was attended by 700 participants in a hybrid format. This activity is a series of collaborations between the ministry and the Seychelles that had been initiated since 2021. He expressed optimism that this activity would be able to raise public awareness on the importance of sustainable management of fisheries resources by applying the blue economy concept and developing creativity and innovation. Radiarta explained that the collaboration aims to ensure the sustainability of fisheries ecosystems in Indonesia and encourage equitable economic distribution in coastal areas. Collaboration is also aimed at boosting the competitiveness of fishery products in the global market and can be a solution to climate issues by maintaining the blue carbon ecosystem. Blue carbon is a reserve of emissions absorbed, stored, and released by coastal and marine ecosystems. In Indonesia, Blue Carbon is spread in coastal ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and peatlands in coastal areas.

60,"Indonesia and Singapore are preparing to work together on a research project on carbon captured and stored by coastal and marine ecosystems.  Findings from the blue carbon project could help Indonesia estimate how much carbon dioxide it can capture and meet its emission reduction targets.  The pilot project will be carried out on Setokok Island in Riau province as soon as the end of this year or early next year, said Dr Kus Prisetiahadi, assistant to the deputy for climate change and disaster management at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment.  Setokok Island, one of the locations of a government-run mangrove rehabilitation programme, was chosen because of its potential blue carbon, the size of its mangrove forests and the variety of its mangroves, Dr Kus said.  ""Indonesia and Singapore are designing a concept note that will serve as guidelines for the research,"" he told The Straits Times.  The project follows a bilateral agreement signed in March and covers collaborations on sustainability and climate change.  Over the years, Indonesia has lost a vast span of mangroves - which can store around four times more carbon dioxide than trees - primarily due to abrasion and land use changes. Its mangrove ecosystems total 3.36 million hectares, and potential areas to rehabilitate come to more than 756,000ha.  Riau province is among nine of 34 provinces prioritised by the Indonesian Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency for its mangrove rehabilitation programme.  Indonesia has a potentially huge amount of blue carbon, especially from mangrove and seagrass, that may reach 3.57 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 17 per cent of the world's carbon, but it is still largely untapped.  Dr Kus said research and technology would be key in maximising the utilisation of the sizeable carbon potential to support economic growth, enhance coastal resilience and mitigate the impact of climate change. ""It is expected that through this research, Indonesia can calculate its potential carbon more accurately by way of advanced technology at the lowest costs possible,"" he said.  A mangrove rehabilitation programme, that may run together with the research on the island, is also expected to drive local economic growth and provide coastal protection, he added.  The project will involve experts from both countries, including those from Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Agency, Bogor Agricultural University and the National University of Singapore (NUS).  Professor Koh Lian Pin, director of NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, told ST the university has been exploring opportunities for research collaboration on nature-based solutions with its counterparts in South-east Asia.  ""For example, there are opportunities to leverage technology to improve our estimates of the carbon stocks and sequestration rates of mangrove forests and other coastal ecosystems,"" he said. ""This research could help unlock the potential of nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation.""  Dr Kus said the research will also pave the way towards a carbon sharing scheme between Indonesia and Singapore. But there are no talks so far pertaining to carbon offset as part of the partnership.

61,"The Indonesian government has teamed up with a local mining company to plant 30,000 mangrove seedlings and releasing 20,000 clams in North Sumatra, as the government earmarked the region as an ideal area for mangrove restoration. The Ministry of Environment and Forestry partnered with Agincourt Resources on World Wetlands Day to plant the seedlings across a 10-hectare area in the Central Tapanuli region along the west coast of Sumatra, which features a coastline stretching some 200 kilometres. We appreciate all parties for this mangrove planting action, hopefully it wont be the last. We hope that there will continue to be support and also other innovations regarding the protection of the sea coast, said Dasrul Chaniago, director of pollution control and coastal and marine damage at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The government said rehabilitating and conserving mangrove ecosystems would help Indonesia achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. Ruli Tanio, deputy president director of Agincourt Resources, said in a statement that planting mangroves could create new economic opportunities for the local communities through ecotourism and sustainable fishing. The company operates the Martabe gold mine in North Sumatra, roughly 30 km from its western coast. We are a mining company whose operational area is not close to the coast. However, we are aware that mangrove forest is a source for protecting aquatic ecosystems between land, coast, and sea with major biological, physical, and economic functions for survival, Tanio said. The company partnered with local farming group Hutan Mandiri Lestari to cultivate the mangrove seedlings, which comprised of local Rhizophora seeds aged 4-6 months that reach a height of 50-80 centimetres. The clam seeds meanwhile were of the locust species, according to the company. Planting is expected to occur over the next 2-3 months, and will be nurtured over two years, with the potential to be extended. The cost and source of funding for the project was not disclosed by Agincourt Resources or the Indonesian government. Based on Indonesias 2021 national mangrove map, the country has an existing mangrove area of some 3.3 million hectares. Unfortunately, Indonesia is losing a significant number of these forests, Dasrul told the Jakarta Post. A 2021 study, conducted by researchers from Singaporean and Indonesian universities, estimated that some 14.1 MtCO2e of carbon emissions were released between 1985-2020 in Indonesia as a result of mangroves forests being converted into coconut plantations. These amounts were almost four and 21 times higher than emissions from land clearing and aquaculture, respectively, as a substantial soil carbon loss occurs as a result of the mangroves being ripped up and replaced with coconuts plantations, according to the study. Our findings imply that improved coastal land management with the avoidance of future mangrove loss is urgently required in order to support national efforts for reducing carbon emissions from the land sector, the study concluded. The government aims to rehabilitate some 600,000 ha of mangroves by 2024, and has mapped around 77,000 ha of land that feature the most suitable conditions. Indra Exploitasia, the Environment and Forestry ministrys biodiversity conservation director, said reforestation was part of the governments contribution to biodiversity loss targets as part of the UNs Convention on Biological Diversity. The Indonesian government has highlighted it efforts preserve seagrass and mangroves as part of its climate change policy to both reduce emissions and improve biodiversity outcomes, and to improve its blue carbon potential.

62,"SINGAPORE: An international institute that will help protect and restore coastal marine ecosystems across Southeast Asia and beyond will be set up in Singapore. The International Blue Carbon Institute, established by Amazon and Conservation International, was launched on Monday (Nov 14) at the COP27 summit in Egypt. Blue carbon is the carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems, such as mangroves and tidal marshes. These ecosystems store large quantities of carbon in both the plants and the sediment below and are recognised as an essential part of the solution to global climate change. ""Southeast Asia, with its vast stretches of mangroves and coastal ecosystems, has tremendous potential for blue carbon initiatives that will also support environmental protection, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods and heritage of local communities,"" said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu at the launch. Working with partners across the region, the institute will build the capacity needed to accelerate and scale up efforts to protect and restore the coastal marine ecosystem, she added. Southeast Asia holds more than one-third of the world's mangrove forests, said Amazon in a press release, adding that the greatest loss of mangrove forests is also in this region. ""In Asia through to the Pacific Islands, coastal communities are increasingly vulnerable to sea-level rise and stronger storms. Blue carbon ecosystems fortify communities against climate effects while providing fresh water, supporting biodiversity, and other natural benefits,"" said Amazon. The institute will serve as a knowledge hub to build capacity, expertise, standards and methodology to develop and scale projects, Amazon added. It will also work with governments across Southeast Asia and beyond to ""integrate blue carbon into climate change mitigation policies"". ""To realise this potential, we need enablers. First, we need to develop the methodologies, tools and scientific research to quantify its benefits,"" said Ms Fu. ""Second, countries need to build up the human capacity to design, develop and implement high-quality blue carbon projects. Third, we need partnerships among stakeholders, in academia, policy, philanthropy, in the region to scale these solutions, and unlock opportunities."" The institute will expand education for practitioners, policymakers and communities to access the latest scientific knowledge, standards, best practices, and resources on blue carbon projects. It will also partner with academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and governments, said Amazon. In the first year, the institute will focus on building tools to support the science-based restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, develop key guidance on blue carbon in Nationally Determined Contributions and expand the knowledge related to the climate value of seagrasses and kelp ecosystems. Amazon will provide a grant of up to US$3 million (S$4.1 million) to establish and fund the institute's operations for the first three years. ""Singapore is excited to partner Conservation International on this momentous initiative, made possible with the support of Singapore's Economic Development Board, Amazon and other partners,"" said Ms Fu. Conservation International will lead the institute. ""We look forward to working with like-minded partners to collectively advance global climate ambition and action to create a better climate future for future generations,"" Ms Fu added.

63,"THUWAL - Mangroves are increasingly being recognized as important players in the fight against climate change. King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has embarked on an ambitious drive in the mangrove forest conservation and enhancement as a key part of the university ever since its establishment. The university is spearheading the planting of mangroves in the winter of 2022 in KAUST's Nature Conservation Area as a project initiated to raise awareness of the negative environmental impact associated with travel-related carbon emissions. With one ""foot"" on land and one in the water, these amphibious plants provide food and shelter for many animals, including birds, crabs, lizards, shrimp, mollusks, stingrays, snails and fish. ""KAUST is home to a thriving mangrove forest spanning more than 110 hectares, including a Nature Conservation Area,"" said Dr. Mohamed Omar, Environmental Protection Manager in the KAUST Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) department. ""Compared to other terrestrial forests, the extensive network of mangrove roots provides an ample opportunity for carbon to sink."" On his part, KAUST Professor Dr. Carlos Duarte said: ""Mangrove forests rank among the most intense carbon sinks in the biosphere, locking much more carbon into their soils than tropical forests. However, when disturbed, the carbon in the soils may be emitted as CO2, so there is an opportunity for climate benefits in both avoiding mangrove losses and restoring lost mangroves."" Mangroves are referred to as blue carbon sinks because of their association with coastal areas; ""blue"" for water, in contrast to ""green"" carbon that is linked with land-based trees. Although mangrove forest conservation and enhancement have been a key part of KAUST since its early days, the planting of mangroves in the winter of 2022 in KAUST's Nature Conservation Area was a project initiated to raise awareness of the negative environmental impact associated with travel-related carbon emissions. As part of KAUST's 2022 Winter Enrichment Program (WEP), Event Chair and KAUST Professor Dr. Peiying Hong discussed with the HSE Department about ways of collaborating to make the event more sustainable. ""Every year, WEP aims to enrich our students' learning experience by inviting globally renowned speakers to share their perspectives in person at KAUST. This incurs a large carbon dioxide footprint,"" Hong said, adding: The WEP theme for 2022 was resilience, and a main focal message of the program was to explore ways to mitigate various tipping points, such as climate change and exhibit resilience. Hence, we wanted to stay true to our theme."" Indeed, the HSE team estimated that this year's WEP speakers covered about 200,000 kilometers in long-distance travel. Having calculated their carbon emissions, the WEP team, in collaboration with HSE and Facilities Management (horticulture), decided to plant more than 200 mangrove plants to not only offset their emissions overtime but also raise awareness about their carbon capture abilities. In the years since KAUST has become a custodian of mangroves, some important discoveries have been made. Duarte said, ""We discovered that Red Sea mangroves, which rank toward the low end in terms of organic carbon sequestration in their soils and biomass, activate an additional mechanism - an alkalinity emission from the dissolution of the carbonate in the bedrock they grow on, which we estimate amplifies their carbon removal capacity by 23 times."" KAUST's mangrove conservation efforts have also revealed how quickly and effectively mangrove colonies can expand when preserved properly. ""Our mangrove forest has grown around 45 percent between 2005 and 2020,"" Omar said, adding, ""this remarkable growth is a combination of natural colonization, replantation efforts, and environmental policy intervention."" Mangrove planting and restoration projects represent a cost-effective way of boosting carbon capture capacity, especially if planned and executed properly, as has been the case at KAUST so far. Hong said, ""The planting of mangroves in this instance is more beneficial than planting land-based trees, which require freshwater irrigation. Mangroves do not need irrigation water since they are planted directly in the coastal areas of the sea."" Already part of the natural landscape of many communities around the world, mangroves serve as a non-invasive carbon mitigation measure, a nature-based solution that has an important role to play in the future. ""Mangroves are definitely one of the ways to achieve our carbon mitigation goals, not simply because they sequester carbon, but also because they offer huge benefits for coastal protection and many other advantages, including fishery enhancement,"" Duarte said. Over the past decade, the level of awareness on blue carbon, and specifically the role of mangroves, has grown. This education must continue, both at policymaker and public levels to boost engagement and uptake of mangrove projects;"" he added.

64,"ABU DHABI, 9th December, 2022 (WAM) - During his ongoing visit to Abu Dhabi, the leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community, Mufaddal Saifuddin, demonstrated his support for the Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative in a gesture that will see over 10,000 new mangrove saplings planted, with the aim of increasing the emirate's total mangrove coverage. This social welfare programme is undertaken as part of the Dawoodi Bohra community's global philanthropic endeavor, Project Rise, and aligns with the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi's long-term, strategic programme to rehabilitate mangrove areas using modern agricultural technologies. Ahmed Alhashmi, Executive Director - Terrestrial and Marine Biodiversity Sector at the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), said, ""Abu Dhabi is eager to use nature-based solutions to mitigate and adapt to fight the effects of climate change, and the Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative is one part of the journey toward strengthening that vision. We're grateful to the Dawoodi Bohra community for their environmental action in supporting the nation's mangrove conservation and carbon sequestration project."" Murtaza Poonawala, the programme coordinator from the Dawoodi Bohras of Abu Dhabi, said, ""Protecting and enhancing the mangrove cover plays a vital role in mitigating climate change. Among a number of other critical functions, mangroves are exceptionally effective in capturing and storing carbon. They also provide a natural habitat for a wide variety of wildlife."" ""The mangrove plantation project will be rolled out in two phases. In the first phase, 5,100 mangroves will be planted as a mark of celebration of the UAE's 51st National Day, and in the second phase, another 5,100 mangroves will be planted in different locations in the Abu Dhabi emirate,"" he added. During COP26 in Glasgow, the UAE announced a nationwide mission to plant 100 million mangroves by 2030 to expand mangrove forest cover within the emirate and restore damaged areas. Additionally, in February of this year, Abu Dhabi set out ambitious plans to establish the emirate as a global hub for research and innovation in support of conservation through the Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative. This was announced during H.H. Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Member of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council and Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Office, meeting with HRH Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge during his landmark visit to the UAE. This initiative is an extension of the Blue Carbon project, focusing on the importance of mangroves and their role in combatting climate change through carbon sequestration. The Dawoodi Bohra community has undertaken several sustained initiatives, including neighbourhood clean-ups and waste management programmes in the region, with the aim of enhancing and improving the climate environment of the UAE.

65,"Manila, March 22 -- Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda underscored the importance of developing sustainable water management and renewed her call for safeguarding the resilience of the country's water resources as a global water crisis challenges the world. ""Water is life, and it affects everyone. As the theme for the observance of World Water Day this year implies, we must accelerate change. This means that we must increase our efforts to save our water resources and ensure a sufficient water supply for present and future generations,"" Legarda said as the country observes World Water Day today. Legarda, a known champion of the environment, said she has been pushing for community and government initiatives to minimize the risk of the country's water resources to run dry, such as reusing wastewater for irrigation, rehabilitation of watersheds through reforestation, and protection of mangrove soils. She emphasized the significance of every individual's actions in saving water and protecting resources. ""Small changes can go a long way. Starting from our homes and workplaces, we can protect and save our water by changing how we use and consume it. There are a lot of simple and easy ways to conserve water, and we must stop disposing pollutants to our rivers,"" Legarda said. In 2004, Republic Act 9275, or the Philippine Clean Water Act, which Legarda authored, was enacted. The law aims to protect the country's water bodies from pollution from land-based sources and by penalizing acts of polluting them. It also provides for establishing multi-sectoral governing boards that manage water quality in local river bodies and other water resources. Legarda has urged the government, as well, to consider investing in blue carbon initiatives through the sustainable management of marine resources and marine-linked sectors, which are also vital for climate change adaptation along the coasts. Last March 14, she filed Senate Bill 1993, or the Blue Economy Act, which seeks to adopt the blue economy as a framework for sustainable, safe use and development of marine wealth within the country's maritime zones. The bill aims to protect and conserve the health and resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems and habitats to promote the well-being, prosperity, and security of present and future generations of Filipinos. ""The country's coastal resources have always been a reliable source of water and food for many Filipinos. Thus, we need to invest in blue carbon initiatives that will help protect our coral reefs, seagrass beds, lush mangrove forests, and other coastal and marine sources,"" Legarda said. ""Let us work together to restore the ecological integrity of our bodies of water,"" she added. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) estimates that around 3.6 billion people worldwide struggle to have access to sufficient and clean water. Co-hosted by the Netherlands and Tajikistan, leaders and stakeholders from countries around the globe are gathering this week in New York City, USA for the United Nation's 2023 Water Conference. The forum seeks better outcomes and solutions on all water-related challenges to fast-track the delivery of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, specifically ensuring sustainable water management for all.

66,"A scientific field trip to a small group of deserted islands on the Great Barrier Reef has its roots in a 1928 expedition and has implications for the future of the reef. A team of researchers from the University of Wollongong led by Associate Professor Sarah Hamylton visited the Howick islands, about 130 kilometres north-east of Cooktown, in far northern Queensland, last year and found the mangroves were expanding. ""What's particularly interesting for a lot of the islands in the Howick group that we are mapping and investigating is that they are growing,"" Associate Professor Hamylton says. ""Most of the islands we have looked at are predominantly made up of broken up corals, which waves then sweep and deposit on the island. This coral sediment is responsible for building up the islands. Add in mangrove forests and you can see that these islands are actually growing. Some mangrove forests are marching forwards by up to five to six metres per year,"" she explains. Associate Professor Hamylton says the group was able to compare aerial images taken by a drone with hand-drawn maps created in 1928 and photographs from 1974. ""This research was started back in 1928 with an expedition known as the Great Barrier Reef Low Isles Expedition."" In July 1928, British and Australian scientists undertook a journey to investigate the biggest coral reef in the world. They spent 13 months wandering reefs and islands, looking at ocean conditions and growth rate of corals. ""Two members of the Great Barrier Reef Low Isles Expedition were particularly interested in how old the reef islands around here are and how were they formed,"" says Associate Professor Hamylton. ""The researchers observed ocean waves and tidal currents transporting loose coral sediments derived from the underlying reef platform and depositing these to form the islands. Sometimes these cays or islands may remain unconsolidated and move around with the seasons. But over time, the larger cays built up to be above the sea level and become covered in vegetation, which stabilises them into more permanent features."" Forty-five years later, in 1973-74, another group of researchers, the Royal Society and Universities of Queensland Expedition, decided to partially retrace the footsteps of the researchers from the 1928 expedition. They concentrated on remapping the Howick group, as well as other islands further north, in more detail. By remapping the islands and collecting more data on mangrove forest vegetation, the researchers believed they could inspire subsequent studies. The information caught the eye of Associate Professor Hamylton who has a keen interest in geomorphology, which examines how landscapes such as the islands on the Great Barrier Reef form and are shaped over time. ""When I looked over the maps from 1928, then some aerial photos from 1974, I then compared these maps and images with recent satellite imagery from the internet and could plainly see that the islands had increased in size. Especially since 1974."" The UOW field trip in June 2021, with funding from the Australian Academy of Science, involves collecting thousands of aerial drone images, ground referencing photographs and mangrove forest surveys of 10 different islands among the Howick group. This data will be used to monitor mangrove expansion and other changes to reef flat environments from island to island. According to Dr Jeff Kelleway, research fellow in the School of Earth, Atmospheric and Life Sciences at UOW, mangroves are magical entities. ""Mangrove forests on these islands are so important. The dense underground root system helps bind soils and build elevation, while the above-ground roots provide shelter for marine life and slows down water flows and encourages sediment deposits that reduce erosion."" While scientists have long known these trees and their ecosystem play a huge role in nurturing fish populations and buffer island shores from storms and ocean surges, it's only recently scientists have realised how important these forests are when it comes to climate change. Rhizophora stylosa, with their tall roots and dense mud beneath, are an efficient tool to remove and store carbon that humans have put in the atmosphere in a process known as ""blue carbon"". ""Mangrove trees capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and then trap and store it in their carbon rich soils for hundreds or thousands of years,"" Dr Kelleway says. ""The term blue carbon came about because the buried carbon is stored underwater in coastal ecosystems."" He says it's only now — in the age of climate change and after a series of reef bleachings — that scientists are beginning to understand how mangrove forests are truly extraordinary in their ability to store carbon, virtually unmatched by any other ecosystem on Earth. While the early results of their field trip showing the expanding mangroves on this one island group are intriguing, the scientists say more work needs to be done to understand broader more destructive changes are happening further north. ""At this early stage of data analysis, it's still too early to have a clear indication as to why. It could be the deforestation of mangrove forests or it could have to do with the health of reef around the islands,"" Dr Kelleway says. According to the research team, the maps from the previous century transformed the way they can respond to historic and contemporary coral reef problems. Associate Professor Hamylton explains the hand-drawn maps were produced using a plane table as a drawing board. The paper was then clamped by heavy screws fitted with large wings. Then along with sighting instruments, a wooden ruler, an ivory scale rule and a trough compass the 1928 team would record distances and transfer their measurements onto paper. The whole kit would then be bundled up into two large stiff canvas bags and transported to the next location. ""Our new mapping with our UAV [drone] not only shows how modern technologies are employed to produce them, but that mapping has been and continues to remain a fundamental activity that underpins the understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation."" On the 27-hour boat trip back to Cairns, the research team sit around a small dinner table and discuss their adventures and discoveries. A PhD student in philosophy Oxana Repina says the research is now more important than ever. ""The fate of the Great Barrier Reef depends on how quickly we address human-made pressures like climate change and try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This place is among the most diverse and iconic ecosystems on Earth. Sure, the media headlines have portrayed the reef as dying or dead, but that's an oversimplification, it's a bit more complicated than that. Let's not write the reef off just yet.""

Credit: Joyce Chimbi/IPS NAIROBI, Oct 7, 2021 (IPS) Smelly, boggy, and full of bugs, mangroves' superpowers are well hidden. However, there is rising confidence that mangroves are the silver bullet to combat the effects of climate change.  Mangrove ecosystems are a habitat and nursery grounds for various plants and animals and can absorb three to four times more carbon than tropical upland forests, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change, Dr. Sevvandi Jayakody, a senior lecturer at Wayamba University of Sri Lanka, tells IPS. Mangrove forests also act as a natural defence against storm surges, including mitigating the effects of cyclones and tsunamis, says Dr Nicholas Hardman? Mountford, Head of Oceans and Natural Resources at the Commonwealth Secretariat. Within this context, he says, Commonwealth countries are working together under theCommonwealth Blue Charter, an agreement made by all 54 member states, to actively work together to tackle ocean-related challenges and meet global commitments on sustainable ocean development. The Blue Charter works through voluntary action groups led by champion countries', who rally around marine pollution and the sustainable blue economy. TheMangrove Ecosystems and Livelihoods Action Groupconsists of 13 countries, including Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Guyana, Jamaica, Kenya, Maldives, Nigeria, Pakistan, Trinidad, and Tobago Vanuatu, and the United Kingdom, is championed by Sri Lanka. Mangrove blue carbon could bolster climate change adaptation, mitigation, and resilience efforts, experts say. Credit: Joyce Chimbi/IPS Hardman? Mountford tells IPS that countries exchange knowledge centered on mangrove protection, management, and sustainability within the action group. Shared knowledge includes a wide range of topics, including policy, legislation, and regulatory frameworks. Leveraging on the protective power of mangroves, Jayakody says that Sri Lanka is actively building its second line of defence. The country's first line of defence, the reefs, were heavily compromised by the deadly 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami one of the worst disasters in modern history, killing nearly 230 000 people across dozens of countries. Such was the devastation that the government of Sri Lanka estimated losses of over $1 billion in assets and $330 million in potential output. Worse still, approximately 35 000 people died or went missing. In Sri Lanka alone, property damage included 110 000 houses, of which 70 000 were destroyed. In all, at least 250 000 families lost their means of support. Experts say that mangroves have immense capacity to prevent such catastrophes and combat other devastating effects of climate change. Bolstered by growing scientific evidence, Trinidad and Tobago, the dual-island Caribbean nation, has made significant strides in building its defence using mangroves. Dr Rahanna Juman, Acting Director at the Institute of Marine Affairs, a government-funded research institute, tells IPS that in 2014, the government of Trinidad and Tobago commissioned an aerial survey of the country. Using this data, an estimate of carbon in mangrove forests across the country was ascertained.  This information illustrated how mangrove and other hardwood forests could offset emissions and was incorporated into the Greenhouse Gas inventory of Trinidad and Tobago. Importantly, the survey conclusively demonstrated that mangrove forests store more carbon per hectare than other hardwood forests, Juman expounds. In 2020, the Institute of Marine Affairs received funding from the British High Commission to fund a mangrove soil carbon assessment project involving Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. Dr Juman indicates that the assessment found that the amount of carbon in the mangrove soil was many times larger than the amount of carbon above the ground. This is an assessment that could be replicated in other Commonwealth countries because we have developed a low-cost technique of undertaking this important assessment.  Adding that Mangroves are starting to be incorporated into the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) program, which means countries could potentially earn money from protecting and restoring mangroves. Meanwhile, Hardman? Mountford cites various challenges in exploring blue carbon because it is still an evolving area of science and policy. Sri Lanka understands this challenge all too well. After the Tsunami, Jayakody says that the government launched vast mangrove restoration projects covering over 2 000 hectares in partnership with other agencies. Due to limited information on mangroves, she tells IPS that a majority of these projects failed. Undeterred and leveraging on scientific research over the years, Sri Lanka is today a success story in restoring and conserving mangrove cover estimated at 19 600 hectares. Other challenges facing countries keen on mangrove blue carbon include a lack of protection for mangroves because approximately 75 percent of mangrove forests globally remain unprotected and overexploited. Over the years, Jayakody indicates that mangroves have been at a very high risk of destruction because their power to prevent coastal erosion, protect shorelines, and provide livelihoods for coastal communities through fisheries was not fully understood. Hardman? Mountford agrees, adding that mangrove forests have declined globally with a loss of between 30 to 50 percent over the past 50 years from over-harvesting, pollution, agriculture, aquaculture, and coastal development. The Commonwealth has a huge role to play in reversing this decline. Overall, there are 47 Commonwealth countries with a coastline.  Nearly 90 percent of Commonwealth countries with a coast have mangroves, and at least 38 of these countries with mangroves have provided some level of protection to their mangroves. In all, 16 countries have protected about half or more of their mangroves, he says. This is a challenge that Sri Lanka is successfully overcoming. With an estimated 40 percent of the population in Sri Lanka living along the coastline, Jayakody says that there was an urgent need to protect both livelihoods and coastlines from further degradation.  In 2015, Sri Lanka established the National Mangrove Expert Committee, and through that, all mangroves were mapped. More so, several new areas were brought under protection, and there have been relentless efforts to improve the communities' understanding of the importance of mangrove ecosystem, she says. Further, Sri Lanka recently validated the Best Practice Guidelines on the Restoration of Mangroves in Sri Lanka and the national mangrove action plan, in line with the mangrove policy adopted in 2020. Other countries making strides in the right direction include the Australian government's involvement with blue carbon and especially ongoing efforts to build capacity in blue carbon science, policy, and economics through multi-sectoral partnerships.  To support its efforts in blue carbon advocacy and outreach, the Australian government launched the International Partnership for Blue Carbon (IPBC) at the UNFCCC CoP in Paris in 2015, says Ms. Heidi Prislan, a Blue Charter Adviser at the Commonwealth Secretariat. Australia is also one of the 28 countries that refer specifically to the mitigation benefits of carbon sequestration associated with coastal wetlands in its National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In comparison, 59 other countries mention coastal ecosystems as part of their adaptation strategies. To increase opportunities for blue carbon to participate in the national emissions reduction scheme, the Emissions Reduction Fund, the Australian government has supported research into potential mitigation methodologies that could be implemented to generate carbon credits from domestic projects. Equally important, she says that Commonwealth member countries have collectively made 44 national commitments to protect or restore mangroves. As the world stares at a catastrophe from the devastating effects of climate change, the massive potential of blue carbon and, more so, mangrove blue carbon to bolster climate change adaptation, mitigation, and resilience efforts can no longer be ignored.

68,"Mangrove forests are disappearing three to five times faster than the world's forests. Today, National Audubon Society and Panama Audubon Society are working in partnership with the Ministry of Environment and the Embassy of the United Kingdom to support the conservation of these ecosystems in the country. Every year, on July 26, several countries around the world celebrate the International Mangrove Ecosystem Conservation Day with the aim of preventing the advance of the destruction of these ecosystems that not only affects nature, but also the human settlements that are located in areas surrounding this type of environment. The Panama Audubon Society reiterated on this date the conservation of these ecosystems for their great benefits: mangroves contribute to food security, filter the waters that flow into the oceans and reef systems and protect coastal communities around the world from storm surges, tsunamis, sea level rise and erosion, therefore, their conservation is a priority. Rosabel Miró, Executive Director of Audubon Panama, said that mangrove ecosystems are home to a rich and enviable biodiversity. ""The fish and crustaceans that grow in mangroves are sources of income for adjacent populations and have become an effective weapon to combat climate change thanks to the tons of carbon they capture. By teaching schools and the general public about the multiple benefits of mangrove forests, we can continue to add allies who act to protect and conserve them,"" said Miró. Meanwhile, Julio Montes de Oca, from the National Audubon Society, pointed out that mangroves are our first line of defense against climate change. At the same time, he affirmed: ""Because of the coastal protection they provide and the services they supply to communities, we must redouble our efforts to conserve and restore them. To understand the magnitude of the importance of these ecosystems, the Panama Audubon Society stated that one hectare of mangrove can store 3,754 tons of carbon. The destruction of mangroves would release the stored carbon into the atmosphere, thus increasing global warming. This year 2022, global actions have grown to support these ecosystems, because despite all the benefits they provide us, mangrove forests are disappearing three to five times faster than the world's forests, with serious ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Threats include coastal construction, pollution, and pressures from agriculture and aquaculture. To help conserve Panama's mangroves, the National Audubon Society and Panama Audubon Society have been working together since last year to value, protect and enhance the coastal natural capital of Panama Bay and Parita Bay with funding from the UK government, administered through the IDB's Natural Capital Laboratory, with support from the Ministry of Environment and the UK Embassy in Panama. This project has as part of its priority interest the conservation of mangrove ecosystems, the establishment of a blue carbon baseline, the knowledge and dissemination of the importance of these two components and the strengthening of public policies that promote the conservation and restoration of mangroves, so they will continue to strengthen this alliance to make these benefits effective. To complement these actions, a virtual regional meeting will be held on Thursday, July 28 under the title 'Blue Carbon and Mangrove Conservation: Experiences of Panama and Colombia'. Experts such as Julio Montes de Oca from National Audubon Society (Costa Rica), Yenifer Diaz from Panama Audubon Society, and Maria Claudia Diaz Granados and Fabio Arjona from Conservation International (Colombia) will participate in this meeting.

69," 30 September 2022 (Antara News) Mangrove forests have huge blue carbon potential in terms of both aboveground and belowground biomass, according to the Environment and Forestry Ministry. Blue carbon can potentially accelerate Indonesia's efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions, a commitment that has been outlined in the nationally determined contributions (NDC) document, director general of sustainable forest management at the ministry, Agus Justianto, explained here on Friday. ""Coastal ecosystem development and mangrove restoration are among the adaption and mitigation efforts against climate change for supporting the target of reducing greenhouse emissions,"" he said during a discussion on mangrove restoration as a solution to national climate change. Blue carbon is carbon that is absorbed and stored in sea and coastal ecosystems. Biomass like leaves, roots, and trunks, as well as mangrove sediment and seagrass meadows, can store four to five times more carbon than forests on land. Justianto said that blue carbon that is stored for long periods is different from green carbon stored in forests for many years. According to him, climate change mitigation can be made more effective if green carbon development on land forests can be followed by blue carbon development and utilization. Since 2010, Indonesia has shown its serious commitment to nurturing mangrove forests through reforestation and restoration. In 2020, coastal ecosystem protection became a strategic step in the recovery process from the COVID-19 pandemic through the organization of a labor-intensive activity of mangrove planting in 34 provinces across Indonesia. ""The labor-intensive program can increase the local economy during the pandemic. The movement of mangrove reforestation is carried out involving all aspects of the government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private parties through the corporate social responsibility (CSR) program at the central and regional levels,"" he explained.

70,"African countries are increasingly turning to mangroves to protect their coasts from climate change. With projects to restore these ecosystems, they also hope to attract investors. Mozambique, as well as Kenya, Madagascar, The Gambia and Senegal, are now active in a large-scale mangrove initiative. Mozambique is touting the world's largest project to sequester carbon in marine ecosystems. By absorbing so-called blue carbon, these systems can remove CO2 from the atmosphere much faster than forests. The partner in the Mozambican initiative to restore mangrove forests, announced in February, is Blue Forest, a company based in the United Arab Emirates. A total of 185,000 hectares of land in the central provinces of Zambezia and Sofala are to be transformed into a forest that could sequester up to 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide. Together, the approximately one million hectares of mangrove forests in Africa could store more CO2 than countries such as Croatia or Bolivia emit annually in pollutants, explains Blue Forest CEO Wahid Fotuhi. In addition, the forests could also protect coastal communities, create green jobs and help preserve biodiversity. Africa's large mangrove forests have been decimated in recent decades by logging, fish farming, coastal development and pollution. As a result, blue carbon emissions increased, coastal sites are more exposed to flood risk. Attention to mangrove restoration was sparked by the successful Mikoko Pamoja project, launched in Kenya in 2013. This protected 117 hectares of mangrove forest and planted 4000 trees annually. The aim was to protect communities from coastal erosion, fish loss and climate change.  ""Mikoko Pamoja"" - Swahili for ""mangroves together"" - was considered the world's first blue carbon project and brought global fame, recognition, new sources of funds and improved living standards to Gazi, a village of 6000 people. Among other things, every household was connected to the water supply, they say. Since then, several other projects have borne fruit. In Senegal, 79 million reforested mangroves are expected to store 500,000 tons of carbon in the coming years. The Gambia launched its own reforestation program in 2017, Madagascar in 2019, and Egypt aims to implement similar plans by November, when it will host the UN Climate Change Conference. Africa remains excluded from many funding opportunities for action on climate change, however, complains Jean Paul Adam, the UN Economic Commission for Africa's senior climate expert. As a result, he says, the continent cannot adequately arm itself against the consequences of global warming. Yet the benefits of reforestation could be immense, explains Marissa Stein of the environmental organization Coral Reef Alliance. ""Restoring and protecting our marine habitats plays a key role in maintaining the health of our planet,"" she says. Mangroves alone store up to four times more carbon per hectare than tropical rainforests, she adds. The Global Mangroves Alliance also estimates that the ecosystem reduces the risks of damage and flooding for 15 million people and prevents more than $65 billion in property damage each year The benefits of reforestation can be immense Marissa Stein, environmentalist Disclaimer: Translation automatically generated.

71,"ORGANIC material within the mangrove system releases methane as it breaks down. However scientists from the University's Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry Research have found the methane being released is offsetting on average 20 per cent of the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere and buried as blue carbon. The paper ""Methane emissions partially offset ""~blue carbon' burial in mangroves"", published today in the highly prestigious journal Science Advances, provides the first estimate of the global magnitude of this offset. ""Our results show that high water and sediment methane emissions have the potential to partially offset ""~blue carbon' burial rates in mangrove sediments on average by 20 per cent,"" lead researcher Dr Judith Rosentreter said. ""The offsets may be as high as 60 per cent around the boundary between the tropics and subtropics, driven by lower mangrove carbon burial rates and higher methane emissions. ""Although there are some uncertainties associated with global emission estimates of methane - mainly due to the lack of data from countries with large mangrove areas such as Indonesia or Brazil - the overall conclusion that there are some offsets remains the same."" Professor Bradley Eyre, director of the Centre for Coastal Biogeochemistry Research at Southern Cross University, is one of the co-authors. ""Methane emissions from mangroves need to be accounted for when assessing their importance in in future ""~blue carbon' assessments and climate change mitigation,"" Prof Eyre said.. As well as offering valuable ecosystem services to the coastal zone and its inhabitants, coastal vegetated ecosystems have been highlighted as efficient natural carbon stores.  The term ""blue carbon"" was coined to describe the carbon sequestered in sediments of mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes and considered as a long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Yet mangrove and other coastal wetlands are threatened ecosystems needing protection and conservation. Climate change is driven primarily by increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere (due to burning of fossil fuel). Climate change mitigation strategies include emission reduction and preserving and enhancing natural carbon stores.

72,"ANKARA The crucial roles of mangroves and threats to these unique ecosystems are taking the global spotlight Tuesday on the occasion of the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem, or World Mangrove Day. The international day, which has been celebrated on July 26 annually since 2015, aims to raise awareness of the importance of mangrove ecosystems as ""a unique, special and vulnerable ecosystem."" Since mangroves grow along tropical coastlines and in saltwater environments on the boundary between land and sea, they are seen as a critical component of marine ecosystems, serving as nursery grounds for many aquatic species, including commercially important fish species. Mangroves also reduce the impacts of storms and keep coastal erosion under control as it is known that mangroves even reduced the impact of the 2004 Southeast Asian tsunami. ""Mangroves act as a form of natural coastal defense against storm surges, tsunamis, rising sea levels and erosion. Their soils are highly effective carbon sinks, sequestering vast amounts of carbon,"" according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UN figures indicate that a hectare of mangrove forest can store 3,754 tons of carbon, which is the equivalent of taking over 2,650 cars off the road for a year. In total, the world's mangroves store carbon equivalent to over 21 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Additionally, mangroves are home to a rich fauna, including 341 internationally threatened species ranging from tigers to seahorses. Mangroves vanishing The area of mangrove habitat in the world is about 135,881 square kilometers (52,464 square miles), which represents a linear coverage of 11.96% of the world's total coastline according to data in 2016. But these rich ecosystems, which also play a crucial role in climate change adaptation and mitigation, are under huge risk as they are disappearing three to five times faster than overall total forest losses. ""It is estimated that some countries lost more than 40% of their mangroves between 1980 and 2005, often due to coastal development,"" Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of UNESCO, said previously. According to the latest statistics, these globally rare forests are found in 123 nations and territories but represent less than 1% of all tropical forests worldwide and less than 0.4% of the global forest estate. These ecosystems are also threatened by conversion into aquaculture and agriculture and urban and resort development as well as rises in sea levels. Since mangroves act as fish nurseries and homes to various species of animals, experts warn that shrinking mangroves may affect coastal communities which depend on fishing to earn a living in the long term. If mangroves are destroyed, degraded or lost, large amounts of carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere, warn experts, adding carbon emissions from mangrove deforestation correspond to up to 10% of emissions from deforestation globally, despite only covering 0.7% of total land coverage. It is also estimated that flood damage would increase by more than $65 billion, while 15 million more people would be flooded every year. Urgent need for protection To stem the alarming decline of mangroves, international organizations including UN institutions and conservation non-governmental organizations (NGOs) continue their efforts towards protection by conducting a number of studies and projects as well as monitoring mangrove resources for conservation purposes. A report titled The State of the World's Mangroves 2021 revealed that the greatest net losses of mangroves were in Southeast Asia, with 6%, and North and Central America and the Caribbean with 7%. Meanwhile, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, Myanmar, Australia, Thailand, Mozambique, Malaysia, India and Bangladesh were the 10 countries worldwide with the largest gains in mangrove habitat extent between 1996 and 2016, noted the report, published by the Global Mangrove Alliance. However, the extent of mangroves around the world decreased by 6,057 square kilometers (2,338 square miles) in total during same period. To revive these vulnerable ecosystems, UNESCO carries out various projects, including the ""Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB)"" and the ""International Blue Carbon Initiative"" as well as the protection of mangroves by naming them ""World Heritage sites."" The Global Mangrove Alliance is making efforts towards mangrove protection by using several tools. Aiming at bringing together governments, NGOs, scientists and local communities, the alliance provides live maps of mangrove estates across the world. ""Green-Grey Infrastructure in the Philippines,"" ""Land-use planning in Liberia"" and ""Valuing Blue Carbon in the Kaimana MPA"" are among the alliance's projects. The annual Mangrove Photography Awards is another initiative to raise awareness in this regard, launched by the US-based nonprofit Mangrove Action Project.

73,"Mangroves are tropical forests that thrive in salt water and are found in a variety of coastal settings from deltas to estuaries to weathered reefs and limestone rocks worldwide. Mangroves can store greater amounts of carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem, which helps reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When carbon is stored in the ocean or coastal ecosystems, including mangrove forests, it is called blue carbon. However, a more precise estimate of how much blue carbon is stored by mangroves around the world has not been available until recently. This research was published in Ecological Society of America's journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. ""While past estimates of blue carbon have done a remarkable job in delivering first order estimates of how ecosystems mitigate carbon enrichment in the atmosphere, we noted that the omission of unique coastal characteristics, such as tides and river flow, reduced the accuracy of global predictions, especially concerning how carbon storages may vary from one country to the next,"" said lead author Robert Twilley, who is a professor in the LSU College of the Coast and Environment's Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences and the executive director of the Louisiana Sea Grant College Program. Twilley and colleagues overlaid a high-resolution map of mangrove forest cover over the various types of nearshore coastal environmental systems to calculate a more accurate estimate of the amount of carbon stored by mangroves in its soil. They found that blue carbon has been underestimated by up to 50 percent in coasts with limestone rock, such as those found on the southern tip of Florida and in the Caribbean. They also found that blue carbon has been overestimated by up to 86 percent in coastal deltas in previous studies. In addition, this study provides new estimates for about 57 countries that lack blue carbon data. ""We have developed a roadmap for ecological investigations on the global scale, highlighting that there may be patterns that govern how mangroves store carbon from the atmosphere,"" said co-author Andre Rovai, who is a postdoctoral researcher in the LSU College of the Coast and Environment's Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences. Having this roadmap is critical given how fast development and land-use changes are occurring around the world. The scientists hope that planners will become more aware of the environmental value of their country's mangroves and take it into account before losing these ecologically important resources.

74,"Human actions have boosted carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to levels higher than any measured over the last 160,000 years. Rising concern over the risk of severe impacts from climate change is spurring research into ways in which ecosystems may mitigate global warming by storing excess carbon in plants and soil.  Our research group has studied the ecology of mangroves for over 40 years. Mangroves are tropical forests that thrive in salt water, forming a canopy with the atmosphere and extensive roots in the sediment of the intertidal zone - the area that is above water at low tide and underwater at high tide. Scientists refer to them as ""blue"" carbon ecosystems, in contrast to ""green"" carbon ecosystems on land, such as forests and grasslands. In a recent study, we estimated that the wood and soil of mangrove forests along the world's coastlines hold 3 billion metric tons of carbon - more than tropical forests.  We have also shown that previous studies have overestimated blue carbon storage in some river delta areas, such as the Amazon in Brazil; the Sundarbans region in India, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers converge; the Zambezi delta in Mozambique; and the Indus river delta in Pakistan. Others have grossly underestimated blue carbon storage in carbonate (peat-dominated) coastlines, such as Belize, the Florida Keys, Puerto Rico, Mexico's Yucatan, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and several Caribbean islands.  The key to improving these estimates, we found, is to factor in how rivers, tides, waves and climate shape coastal landforms to create different environmental settings. Using this approach, we have produced a more accurate estimate of global blue carbon ""hot spots"" - an important first step toward protecting them. Adapted to many settings Mangroves can extend along tropical shorelines to the very edge of warm temperate climate zones, controlled by changing frequency of frosts. They grow where tides and salt from oceans meet rivers carrying sediments from continents, mixing to form different types of intertidal zones.  Deltas exist where large rivers with very turbid waters and very little salt deliver sediment to the coast, forming extensive mud banks. In contrast, lagoons and coasts formed mainly of carbonate rock, such as chalk or limestone, have beautiful blue salty waters and firm sandy or coraline sediment along shorelines. In a middle category, estuaries form where rivers meet the sea and tides mix fresh and salt waters, forming brackish water that changes seasonally as river levels rise and fall.  Mangroves grow very differently in these various settings. In deltas, some of the largest mangrove trees in the world reach the heights of rain forests, with extensive roots penetrating into soft silty mud. In contrast, mangrove trees growing in the sediments of a carbonate shoreline are so much smaller that they look stunted, like ornamental trees in public parks.  Carbon stocks in coastal environmental settings Why do mangrove trees grow so differently in different environments? In our view, the explanation lies in how climate, rivers, tides and waves form conditions for mangrove tree growth.  The mud in deltas and estuaries with large tides contains high concentrations of essential nutrients. This creates benign environments where trees grow to their full potential. In contrast, coastlines where sediments are made of carbonate and tides are small tend to be nutrient-poor. This stunts tree growth and produces scrub forests along the shore.  As mangrove trees grow, they store carbon from the atmosphere in their wood. More carbon builds up in mangrove soils with the accumulation of organic matter, such as dead leaves and branches. We wanted to know whether the ecological conditions that control mangrove growth in different settings could also indicate how much blue carbon these ecosystems accumulate over their lifetime, or how much carbon they sequester each year.  Annual carbon sequestration by mangroves There is no question that mangrove wood and soils around the world have accumulated significant quantities of carbon since they started to grow. Mean values range from 50 metric tons of carbon per acre (125 metric tons per hectare) in delta settings to as much as 220 metric tons per acre (550 metric tons per hectare) in carbonate coastlines.  For the purpose of curbing climate change, the most important question is how much carbon an ecosystem sequesters each year, mitigating carbon emissions produced from human activities such as burning fossil fuels. Carbon sequestration by mangrove forests is the amount of carbon that accumulates in wood or soils each year and remains stockpiled there, isolated from the atmosphere. In total, the world's mangroves sequester approximately 24 million metric tons of carbon in soil per year. A mangrove forest on the Pacific island of Kosrae, in Micronesia, can store as much carbon annually as a tropical rain forest in Panama.  Our review found very significant differences in the rate of carbon uptake by different types of mangrove forests. Mangrove soils in the intertidal zone gain elevation as sediments are deposited each year. Coastal zones with major rivers have some of the highest rates of soil formation, so they also have high annual carbon sequestration rates. Since mangrove trees grow taller in these more benign delta environments, they also sequester more carbon in their wood each year.  Overall, mangroves in deltaic coasts such as the Mississippi River delta, the Amazon in Brazil and the Sundarbans in India and Bangladesh can sequester more carbon yearly than any other aquatic or terrestrial ecosystem on the globe. These are the world's blue carbon hot spots. However it is important to distinguish between carbon density in mangrove soils - the amount of carbon stored per unit area - and carbon sequestration, which is the amount of carbon that accumulates in that same area per year. Carbon sequestration is enhanced in deltaic environments because rivers continuously deposit sediment in mangrove soils. This leads to higher burial rates of carbon, both from the trees themselves and from carbon carried by the rivers.  Delta soils also contain a lot of mineral sediment (rock), so they have a relatively low carbon content by volume. In contrast, in carbonate settings such as Caribbean islands, most of the soil volume is made up of plant roots, so it has a higher carbon content. But soil builds up in deltas more quickly, since rivers are always depositing new sediment.  This distinction is important for conservation strategies. Destroying mangrove forests to build roads, shrimp ponds or other commercial projects can release significant quantities of carbon to the atmosphere - even in carbonate settings, since so much of the soil there consists of plant material. This makes it important to conserve mangroves in all types of settings.  It also is very important to restore mangroves, particularly in deltaic regions, where they can increase those ecosystems' capacity to clean the atmosphere of existing carbon dioxide. By improving our understanding of how mangroves function under different conditions, we can safeguard and increase these valuable blue carbon stores.

75,"A Mary Kay-supported project focused on women and conservation was featured in a panel session called Innovation and adaptation - coastal solutions to climate change at the Economist Impacts World Ocean Summit Asia Pacific in Singapore. The panel discussion covered how the effect of climate change is having on Asia-Pacifics coastal ecosystems as well as on global oceans. It featured case studies on how the region is preparing for and adapting to climate change. Mary Kay Inc, a global advocate for corporate sustainability and stewardship and signatory to the UN Global Compact Sustainable Ocean Principles, continues to support global efforts to increase ocean awareness and highlight the important role the ocean plays in efforts to combat climate change. Mangroves are vital to coastal ecosystems yet are one of the most threatened ecosystems on the planet, it said in a statement. To create long-term solutions for mangroves in Papua New Guinea, Mangoro Market Meri - an initiative supported by The Nature Conservancy and Mary Kay - is linking local efforts, ecotourism, and blue carbon (the carbon that is captured by the world's oceans and coastal ecosystems) to create incentives for mangrove protection and restoration. The women of Mangoro Market Meri market produce sustainable mangrove products, such as shellfish and mud crabs to generate much-needed income and employment opportunities while also protecting mangroves from being harvested for their wood. With Mary Kays support, the women of Mangoro Market Meri receive training in gender equity, leadership, financial literacy, and business management. Mary Kay is committed to being a good steward of natural resources while fostering gender equality and womens empowerment in conservation across the globe.

76," March 16 -- Bladderwrack in the Baltic Sea emits significant amounts of methane, which, to some extent, can offset the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by these algae. This is shown by a new study from Askö Laboratory, where the fluxes of greenhouse gases between surface waters and the atmosphere were measured continuously over several seasons.   ""It was a bit surprising that methane was emitted from the bladderwrack, since this algae grows on hard substrates and not on soft sediments, where methane is produced normally,"" says Christoph Humborg, scientific director of Stockholm University Baltic Sea Center and co-author of the new study published in Nature Communications. ""But what we found was that these algae form pockets of sediment where methane forming microorganisms, archaea, could be detected. We found these archaea also on floating filamentous algae and organic matter debris associated with dense stands of bladderwrack."" Coastal ecosystems can take up and store large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so-called ""blue carbon."" Restoring such ecosystems could therefore be an important nature-based solution to mitigate climate change. Well-known blue carbon ecosystems include mangrove, sea grass meadows and salt marshes. However, more recently, it has been suggested that also macroalgae, such as the bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus)-common to the Baltic Sea-can take up large amounts of atmospheric carbon. If this carbon is, for example, exported to and sequestered in the deep sea, macroalgae could be one of the most important blue carbon ecosystems globally. Bladderwrack forests take up significant amounts of carbon dioxideIn the recently published study, with Florian Roth as first author, researchers from Stockholm University and University of Helsinki in the collaboration CoastClim measured greenhouse gas fluxes between the water surface and atmosphere outside the Askö Laboratory in Trosa over a whole year, using the Water Equilibration Gas Analyzer System, WEGAS. The measurements confirmed that mixed vegetation and bladderwrack forests in the coastal zone do take up significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The fluxes vary over the year, but altogether the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over the bladderwrack habitats added up to 0.52 tons CO2 per hectare and year, which can be compared with 0.71 ton CO2 per hectare and year for areas with mixed vegetation. However, this uptake is offset by methane fluxes from the water to the atmosphere from the very same environments. As methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, the net carbon uptake is reduced to 0.38 ton and 0.46 ton CO2-eq. (carbon dioxide equivalents, meaning the global warming potential of the gases converted to that of carbon dioxide) per hectare and year for bladderwrack and mixed vegetation sites, respectively.   Macroalgae habitats important from a climate perspectiveAs awareness is rising of the potential of blue carbon habitats and the possibility to include them in climate mitigation strategies, it is increasingly important to quantify the fluxes of greenhouse gases and the net carbon uptake in these environments correctly. ""Caring for and restoring macroalgae habitats could still be important from a climate perspective. Our study shows that these environments are net carbon sinks, just not as large as has sometimes been suggested,"" Christoph Humborg clarifies. From a management perspective, it is also important to know whether methane production in the macroalgae habitats is influenced by their health status, i.e., whether macroalgae habitats in eutrophic degraded systems produce more methane than healthy macroalgae stands. This hypothesis will be tested by the Swedish-Finnish researcher group in mesocosm-experiments next year. ""Our measurements were done in situ in the Baltic Sea, which is affected by eutrophication,"" says Christoph Humborg. ""A less eutrophic ecosystem with less organic matter accumulation and less filamentous algae growth could likely produce less methane. If so, taking measures to help the Baltic Sea recover from eutrophication would substantially improve the blue carbon potential of these habitats and contribute to mitigating climate change.""

77,"When hurricanes Opal and Roxanne both hit the Mexican state of Yucat\xE1n in a ten-day period in 1995, they destroyed much of the mangrove forest in the small coastal community of San Crisanto. The local people responded by replanting mangroves and clearing channels among the trees to allow water to flow freely. They committed to protect the ecosystem. Today it\x92s a conservation success story, with the restored mangroves protecting the coastline, sustaining wildlife and supporting livelihoods based on fishing and ecotourism. Now, after 27 years of hard work, the community is reaping new benefits by capitalizing on the carbon the mangroves contain. They are selling Mexico\x92s first carbon credits based on the so-called \x91blue carbon\x92 of marine ecosystems. \x93We have been the first to do so,\x94 says to IPS Jos\xE9 Loria, the president of the community\x92s San Crisanto Foundation. \x93We are pioneers. We built the project, we designed it. It is a meaningful issue, relevant to the area. It's a long-term project.\x94 Mexico has huge reserves of blue carbon and, as San Crisanto shows, it can generate finance that supports conservation and sustainable livelihoods. But Mexico has no national policies and plans for tapping into this potential, and blue carbon gets scant mention in the country\x92s climate change commitments. Lacking support, communities, companies and nongovernmental organizations are pushing on anyway. Rising market Mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes hold back waves, limit erosion and lessen the impacts of rising sea levels, so their conservation is a nature-based adaptation to the climate crisis. But these ecosystems also capture and store vast amounts of organic carbon, so they play a key role in limiting the global heating that causes climate change in the first place. There comes its \x93blue carbon\x94 name. For the captured and stored carbon dioxide (CO2), the mangroves owners can issue certificates for selling in domestic and international markets to corporations interested in reducing their polluting emissions. Companies and individuals can buy these credits on what is known as the voluntary carbon market to offset their greenhouse gas emissions \x97 each credit represents the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In fact, a mangrove absorbs 5-10 times more carbon than a tropical forest of the same area. This is especially relevant for Mexico, which has a greater area of blue carbon ecosystems than most other countries. In 2020, for example, it had 905 086 hectares of mangroves \x97 only Indonesia, Australia and Brazil have more. This means that Mexico is well-placed to benefit from the emerging trade in blue carbon credits. \x93The voluntary carbon market is in full growth, as more and more companies are integrating carbon credits into their environmental strategies to complement the measurement and reduction of their emissions,\x94 says Alessandra Souroujon, a senior analyst at Climate Seed \x97 a carbon trade broker based in Paris. \x93It is expected that this trend will continue to increase and, with it, more projects of this type [blue carbon] will be developed.\x94 In an e-mail to IPS, Souroujon emphasized challenges, such as the cost of certification and the need for long-term community commitment and the right project partners. She said the success of San Crisanto shows the potential for the trade in blue carbon to finance the conservation and restoration of mangroves, and to produce income to develop the community and improve the quality of life there. San Crisanto shows how San Crisanto is located in the Sinanch\xE9 municipality, about 1 360 kilometers southeast of Mexico City. It is an ejido \x97 an area of land owned by the state but held and managed communally by local people. A few dozen meters from the village\x92s sea-bleached sandy streets, spreads a green blanket of tall, thin trees. They are the 850 hectares of mangroves that the community has preserved since 1995. The forest has four species of mangrove trees: red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), white (Laguncularia racemosa), black (Avicennia germinans) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus). It is a haven for fish, turtles, crocodiles and 167 bird species, including pink flamingos that have returned to the area after a gap of 50 years. Having spent years counting species there, the local land managers are now counting how much blue carbon the mangroves hold. The venture, with 125 000 dollars of investment from the ejido\x92s coffers, started in 2015 with the measurement of carbon in mangrove tree trunks and branches. It took a few years of trial and error to get the methodology right before the ejido could report its data to a certification body for verification. This was completed in March 2022 by the Mexican subsidiary of the Colorado\x92s Ruby Canyon-based Ruby Canyon Environmental Inc. Loria told IPS that the ejido\x92s carbon credits are being sold in the international voluntary market for more than 20 dollars per ton of carbon. This is a noteworthy fee \x97 four times more than the price of carbon credits from some projects in terrestrial forests in Mexico. One European company producing luxury goods has already bought more than 10 000 offsets from the ejido. But this is just the start. This year, the measurement of above-ground carbon totaled 25 tons per hectare. The number of offsets the ejido can sell is set to increase as the mangroves grow and once the ejido has also quantified the carbon in the roots and sediment. \x93The revenues will strengthen the project,"" says Loria. In an announcement published on 31 May 2022, the San Crisanto Foundation said it would use the money generated by selling carbon credits \x93to maintain the mangrove forest, fund environmental education, strengthen local culture and traditions, and enhance public services, improving the community\x92s quality of life\x94. Lost at sea Despite Mexico\x92s potential, cases like San Crisanto happen in a vacuum as there is no national blue carbon strategy. In 2021, a non-governmental organization, The Nature Conservancy Mexico, produced a roadmap for developing such a strategy but it has not published it. Blue carbon does feature in the commitments Mexico has made under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, in a periodically updated document called a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The latest NDC, from 2020, mentions \x93strengthening instruments and executing actions for biodiversity conservation and the restoration of marine, coastal and freshwater ecosystems, as well as increasing and maintaining carbon reservoirs, with emphasis on blue carbon\x94. The NDC notes that blue carbon can contribute to ten of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that the international community adopted in 2015 at the United Nations to achieve by 2030. These include the goals on clean water, climate action, underwater life and terrestrial ecosystems. Similarly, while the country\x92s Climate Change Strategy for Protected Natural Areas 2015-2040 aims to mitigate the climate crisis through carbon capture and storage, it only mentions blue carbon once, in relation to mapping the resource in those areas. More than half of Mexico\x92s mangroves \x97 some 464 000 hectares \x97 are preserved in these areas, which are under the jurisdiction of the governmental National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (Conanp). They represent a great opportunity for blue carbon projects, but Conanp lacks precise CO2 measurements at each site. This is a challenge as the carbon content of mangrove forests varies greatly. While San Crisanto has 25 tons of above-ground carbon per hectare, other mangroves in Mexico have several hundred tons. There is even more carbon underground \x97 as much as 1 000-2 000 tons per hectare. But while above ground carbon can be quantified with satellite-based measurements, CO2 in roots and sediments must be laboriously measured on site. A Conanp document seen by IPS recommends advancing the quantification of blue carbon deposits, the formulation of regulations including to count emissions from coastal degradation, and the promotion of regulated trading schemes for offsets. When IPS asked Conanp to comment about the lack of a national strategy, a spokesperson replied that, \x93it has not been possible to consolidate the efforts between the various stakeholders and the financing needed for the generation of an effective strategy, which contemplates the diversity of existing contexts\x94. Conanp acknowledged that it seeks strategies to take advantage of the potential of the carbon market, \x93with special emphasis on all the mechanisms used being translated into social benefit of the legitimate holders of environmental assets"". It says, the roadmap for a strategy must cover at least a 10-year period and include the quantification of the contribution of blue carbon ecosystems to the climate action and the mobilization of climate finance for its management. Joanna Acosta, a conservation biologist at the state-run Autonomous University of Carmen, located in Ciudad del Carmen (Campeche), says to IPS the environmental authorities already know what to do, but there has been no political will to move forward with policies that support blue carbon projects. \x93They are long-term projects,\x94 she says. \x93There has to be a very clear vision that it is meant to conserve and restore mangroves, and that the money from the offsets has to be invested again in the community. In Mexico we are not ready for carbon credits. There are many expectations, but nothing is clear.\x94 Acosta proposed a roadmap that generates institutional arrangements and clear rules, \x93so that each party knows what their responsibility is, from the community, which is close to the resource, to academia, in support of the community, and the government\x94. Jorge Herrera, academic at the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the state-run National Polytechnic Institute, says there is too much emphasis on carbon offsets, and that other conservation approaches are also needed to protect mangroves. \x93The benefits depend on the carbon in the mangroves, not just the credits,\x94 he told IPS. \x93What is least known is carbon in the soil, of which we know very little. Those in charge of the policies should explain why blue carbon mechanisms are missing.\x94 Slow carbon Despite the absence of enabling policies, some blue carbon projects are trying to make progress. In Magdalena Bay, in the northern state of Baja California Sur, the private Corporaci\xF3n MarVivo is developing the MarVivo Blue Carbon Conservation Project in partnership with local communities. By conserving 22 000 hectares of mangroves, it aims to offset 26 million tons of CO2 emissions over 30 years. In November 2021, the company and the US private corporation Carbon Streaming announced an investment agreement through which the latter will invest six million dollars in the implementation, with an initial disbursement of two million. Upon the project reaching its goals, the fund will deliver four installments of one million dollars and will have the right to buy more than 200 000 credits each year. Several other initiatives want to take off, but they face barriers, mainly financial. Nongovernmental organization Costasalvaje\x92s Blue Carbon Project aims to protect 33 891 hectares of mangroves in the Gulf of California, in northern Mexico. The organization is working with the El D\xE1til community to restore degraded red mangroves in the El Vizca\xEDno Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur. It is also working with the women's group \x93Guardians of the Conchalito\x94 to restore the mangroves of El Conchalito Estuary, near the state capital La Paz. The organization has estimated that a 16 592-hectare area of mangroves in northwestern Mexico stores 20-million tons of carbon, equivalent to the emissions of 608 944 cars in a year. On the southern side of the Gulf of California, in the western states of Nayarit and Sinaloa, TNC Mexico identified 80 000 hectares for protection and regeneration in the Marismas Nacionales Biosphere Reserve. Closer to San Crisanto, in Yucat\xE1n state, the Sisal ejido in the Hunucm\xE1 municipality is preparing to launch the trade of carbon credits from 5 060 hectares of mangroves. It aims to sell 3.18 million credits over 30 years. And in south-eastern Mexico, in Quintana Roo state, a consortium led by the non-governmental Resiliencia Azul is seeking 100 000 dollars to certify carbon and issue offsets in a project called Taab Ch\xE9 (mangrove, in the indigenous Mayan language). The project is working in the Yum Balam Flora and Fauna Protection Area, whose 7 265 hectares of mangroves are mostly in good condition, and the Isla Cozumel Natural Areas which have 3 011 hectares of mangroves, with almost half being well preserved. A possible future Back in San Cristanto, Loria says that other communities seeking to capitalize on the blue carbon in their mangroves will need trust and patience. \x93They have to be sure of what they want to do,\x94 he says. \x93If the community wants to, it doesn't need a national framework. We did it, period. It depends on the maturity of the organization, the work that has been done. It doesn\x92t happen by spontaneous generation.\x94 But Tannia Frausto, the climate change manager for Costasalvaje, stresses the need for policies that can be applied locally. \x93If there was a national strategy, with clear policies and funding, and it was a priority, the conservation of those ecosystems could be sped up and prioritized,\x94 she says. \x93Mangroves are already a resource we have, so the job is to take care of them. It is urgent to create the legal framework that allows optimizing resources. Environmental degradation is going faster than what can be protected with the current instruments.\x94 Frausto recommends closing the gap between investment and ecosystem recovery. \x93At a global level, companies are going to need carbon offsets, not only to mitigate [their emissions] but because of a sense of social responsibility,\x94 she says. \x93While offsets are not the ultimate goal, they allow entrepreneurs, bankers and communities to be brought together and seated at the same table. That's the added value.\x94 This story was produced with support from the Internews Earth Journalism Network.

78," 8 September 2021 (Antara News) The Environment and Forestry Ministry drew attention to the importance of conservation to control climate change through the marine and coastal sectors. ""It should be noted that efforts to control climate change from the marine and coastal sectors is highly dependent on coastal and marine conservation itself,"" Director General of Climate Change Control (PPI) Laksmi Dwanthi stated during a virtual discussion on blue carbon here on Wednesday. It is since coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses, can store and produce carbon or better known as blue carbon. Blue carbon is currently considered as an important ecosystem since it can absorb greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the forestry, energy, agriculture, and industry sectors are being prioritized to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the potential for carbon sequestration and storage in the mangrove ecosystem will also be taken into account based on its ability to store carbon. ""The marine sector, including blue carbon, has actually been included in the calculation, especially mangroves or soils in mangroves. We will continue to look for other potential mangrove ecosystems that can absorb carbon,"" she affirmed. Dwanthi explained that Indonesia continued to ensure a vision related to marine and climate change, along with other archipelagic countries in the world on account of the blue carbon potential. Indonesia has vast blue carbon potential on account of the presence of about 3.3 million hectares of mangroves that can store 950 tCO2e of carbon per hectare and about three million hectares of seagrass beds that can store 119.5 tCO2e of carbon per hectare.

79," 11 October 2022 (Antara News) The Environment and Forestry Ministry invites business actors to contribute to mangrove forest restoration and conservation as one of the attempts to mitigate the impacts of climate change in Indonesia. ""Protecting mangroves as a blue carbon ecosystem does not only aim to reduce emissions and increase carbon sequestration but also to preserve healthy mangroves that can provide benefits for the community's welfare,"" Director General of Sustainable Forest Management at the ministry Agus Justianto noted in a press release on Tuesday. The ministry estimated that the forestry and other land use sector in Indonesia will be able to absorb around 113.18 gigatons of carbon, with 33 billion tons absorbed by mangrove forests, 55 billion tons by peatlands, and 25.18 billion tons by tropical forests. In addition, Indonesia's carbon trade potential is projected to reach Rp350 trillion. Mangrove ecosystems have a quite high blue carbon value and play a major role in achieving the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, so their restoration must be supported by all parties. The director general assessed that restoration attempts are important to bolster the resilience of Indonesia's coastal areas to face various environmental problems. 'Marine resource and ecosystem management aims to overcome natural resource degradation, climate change and marine pollution, as well as socio-economic vulnerability of coastal communities,"" he remarked. Indonesia has the largest mangrove forest area in the world. According to the One Map Mangrove Indonesia, the total area of the country's mangrove forests reaches 3.3 million hectares, or equivalent to 20 percent of the total area of mangrove forests in the world. Deputy Head for Environment and Forestry at the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) Silverus Oscar Unggul said his side had encouraged business players to collaborate to restore mangroves in Indonesia. Several business players, such as state-run oil and gas company PT Pertamina (Persero), state-owned electricity provider PT PLN (Persero), state-run tin mining corporation PT Timah, as well as private-owned energy company PT Indika Energy, have actively contributed to the preservation of mangrove ecosystems through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs.

80,"DUBAI, 1st November, 2022 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) hosted the sixth National Dialogue for Climate Ambition (NDCA) that explored the role of nature-based solutions in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Held under the theme ""Promoting the creation and implementation of innovative and sustainable nature-based solutions"", the event took place at Anantara Eastern Mangroves Abu Dhabi Hotel. The session convened around 50 representatives of relevant public and private sector entities. Federal government authorities included the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Office of the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change, Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR), General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), and Emirates Green Building Council. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), Abu Dhabi Department of Energy, Dubai Municipality; Emirates Nature-WWF, Zayed International Foundation for the Environment, and International Centre for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA); were also in attendance. The event also drew the participation of several local and international companies, including Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Mubadala, ADQ, TAQA, Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC), Essa Al-Ghurair, Aldar, Farnek Services, HSBC, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Distant Imagery. The sixth instalment in the series highlighted the UAE's efforts to leverage blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, saltmarshes, and seagrass meadows, to address climate change. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, praised the outstanding work of EAD in this regard. ""Mangrove forests offer significant climate change mitigation and adaptation co-benefits. To strengthen our blue carbon ecosystems, we proactively work to expand our mangrove cover. In December 2020, we submitted our second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement that included planting an additional 30 million mangroves by 2030. And less than a year later, at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November 2021, we announced an increase in our mangrove-planting target to 100 million by 2030. ""The UAE is home to more than 63 million mangroves that form forests spanning 183 square kilometres and capture 43,000 tonnes of CO2 annually. The new target, captured in the country's updated second NDC, will bring up its total mangrove forest area to 483 square kilometres and increase the CO2 sequestration rate to 115,000 tonnes per year,"" she said. For his part, Steven Lutz, Senior Programme Officer and Blue Carbon Lead at GRID-Arendal, a Norwegian foundation and partner of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), offered an in-depth insight into ways of using ocean-based solutions to capture CO2. ""Oceans absorb around one-third of human-generated emissions, and marine life, such as whales, fish, and sea turtles, plays a key role in this process,"" he said. Lutz pointed out the difference in the carbon sequestration capacity of a living ocean versus a depleted one, emphasising the importance of conserving ocean ecosystems and reversing the overfishing crisis. The agenda also featured an introduction of the National Carbon Sequestration Project, a presentation on EAD's efforts, and briefs on projects aimed at transforming captured CO2 and mineralising it into rock. In addition, the participants finalised the ""100 Million Mangroves Plantation Plan"", the implementation mechanism for the latest mangrove-planting target.

Oceans absorb around one-third of human-generated emissions, and marine life, such as whales, fish, and sea turtles, plays a key role in this process. For instance, an average great whale sequesters an estimated 33 tons of carbon when it dies and sinks to the ocean floor. Meanwhile, phytoplankton, whose productivity is enhanced by whales, captures 37 billion tons of CO2 per year. Essentially, one whale is worth a thousand trees in terms of carbon absorption. Combined with other economic benefits, researchers estimate the value of each great whale to amount to US$2 million.

82,"Pakistan, Dec. 19 -- Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam Friday said the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC) has initiated Blue Carbon Initiate in collaboration with the World Bank to estimate and value the carbon absorbed by the mangroves planted at costs and under the ocean limits of the country that help fight climate change. He said, in a tweet video, Pakistan's Blue Carbon initiative was started with the World Bank to estimate, value and save this Nature Based Tool which fight global Climate Change. Amin said a recent World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF-Pakistan) research claimed that since 1990 Pakistan's mangroves had increased 300 times and was the only country with rising number of mangroves. The credit for this success was of WWF-Pakistan, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Sindh government for managing to secure the natural reserve, he added. The SAPM informed that under the Prime Minister's Climate Action initiative and 10 Billion Tree Tsunami Project an additional One billion mangrove trees would be planted to further boost the green cover around the coastal areas of the country Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Right Vision News.

83,"GENEVA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 55 percent of China's mangroves are included in protected areas, making it one of the few countries in the world with a net increase in mangrove areas, a Chinese official said Monday at the ongoing Ramsar Convention meeting in Geneva.  At a side event named ""Global Mangrove into 2030/2050"" held during the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP14), more than 100 representatives worldwide reviewed global mangrove conservation and exchanged views on the current status of mangroves and their role in the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as challenges and opportunities in mangrove conservation practices.  Li Chunliang, deputy director of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration of China, said that thanks to China's continuous efforts, more than 55 percent of the country's mangroves have been included in protected areas, while the protection and management of mangroves have been strengthened in accordance with China's wetland protection law and other laws and regulations.  China's mangrove area has increased from 22,000 hectares (220 square km) in 2001 to 27,000 hectares (270 square km) today, becoming one of the few countries in the world with a net increase in mangrove areas, he said.  China's success in mangrove conservation was commended by experts and officials at the side event.  Stuart Crane, project coordinator for SDG6 of the UN Environment Program, said at the side event that China has shown real political momentum towards the protection of mangrove ecosystems, which is ""very positive and something that many other countries can learn from.""  Jerker Tamerlane, director of science and policy at the Ramsar Convention Secretariat, said that China has provided a good example for wetlands conservation with its mangrove conservation and restoration plan for 2020 to 2025, which ""encompasses targets that are quite specific, quite quantitative"" to ""bring together really convening multiple efforts under one umbrella.""  Mangroves, known as ""coastal guardians,"" ""havens for birds"" and ""habitats for fish and shrimp,"" are one of the most important blue carbon ecosystems that play an important role in purifying seawater, preventing wind and waves, maintaining biodiversity and storing carbon.

84," One of Rabobanks top executives, Berry Marttin, has declared his excitement about the opportunities presented by blue carbon initiatives for the shrimp sector opportunities hes only become aware of in the last 2-3 months.  In a presentation titled Feeding the world sustainably, which he delivered at this weeks Global Shrimp Forum, Marttin emphasised the huge potential offered by blue carbon and how the shrimp farming sector is well placed to capitalise on this, through initiatives such as mangrove restoration.  I didnt know so well until a couple of months ago the huge positive impact that blue carbon can have on your industry, he admitted, pointing to the fact that the most recent report by IPCC emphasises the possibility of carbon sequestration to absorb 4 billion tonnes of the food industrys carbon emissions through regenerative farming, but ignores blue carbon.  If you eat this shrimp you are contributing to the environment, not taking away from the environment. I may be dreaming, but I do think that I could try to make a case about that  But there was no rapping about the blue carbon about the possibility in the mangroves, in the areas that your farmers are taking care of, of capturing carbon, he noted.  While terrestrial initiatives can achieve 1-2 tonnes of carbon capture a year, coastal ones such as mangrove restoration can achieve 5 tonnes per hectare, he observed. If this was monetised at a rate similar to terrestrial carbon capture projects, this could have a significant impact for small-scale shrimp farmers in particular.  Five tonnes per hectare is an additional income of at least $500 per hectare, he explained.  Marttin also noted that most of the shrimp sectors emissions occur surprisingly at the farm level, rather than through feed. And pointed to the possibilities offered by using more solar power, for example, rather than diesel generators to power aeration systems.  So, I could imagine that if you added lower emissions at the farm level by changing some of the practices and you add the 5 tonnes per hectare of emissions because you integrate with the blue mangroves. Wow! Basically, you produce a net positive shrimp. You can say to your consumer, that basically if you eat this shrimp you are contributing to the environment, not taking away from the environment. I may be dreaming, but I do think that I could try to make a case about that.  I can only see your industry as an industry that is extremely important for the livelihoods of billions, an industry that has a low carbon footprint and industry that has a high nutritional density, as one of the winners of what we really need to do we need to make this work, he concluded.

85,"SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt To help mitigate climate change and protect coastal communities, a new institute will be supporting the restoration and protection of ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrasses in South-east Asia and beyond.   Announcing this at Singapore's pavilion on the sidelines of the COP27 climate conference in Egypt, Amazon and Conservation International said they will be establishing an International Blue Carbon Institute, which will be housed in Singapore.   Blue carbon refers to the carbon dioxide stored in coastal and marine ecosystems like mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes that sequester and store large quantities of carbon in both plants and sediments, thus playing an essential role in the solution to global climate change.  Speaking at the institute's launch on Monday evening, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the implementation of these blue carbon initiatives will allow countries to realise their climate ambition -- both in mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.  Mangrove forests, for example, are known to be coastal guardians and can help protect communities from heavy flooding and sea-level rise.   ""South-east Asia, with its vast stretches of mangroves and coastal ecosystems, has tremendous potential for blue carbon initiatives that will also support environmental protection, biodiversity conservation, and livelihoods and heritage of local communities,"" she added.  According to a report looking at the state of the world's mangroves, South-east Asia holds over one-third of the world's mangrove forests. But the greatest loss of mangrove forests has also occurred in this region, largely due to factors such as the expansion of aquaculture and oil palm plantations.  With support from the Economic Development Board, the International Blue Carbon Institute will serve as a knowledge hub to build capacity, expertise and standards to develop and scale these blue carbon projects.  The institute will work with governments across South-east Asia and the Pacific to integrate the use of blue carbon into policies for mitigating climate change, and expand education for policymakers and communities on blue carbon projects.  Dr Emily Pidgeon, who is vice-president of ocean science and innovation at Conservation International, told The Straits Times that a mangrove forest stores about 10 times the carbon per unit area compared with terrestrial forests, but these projects can be difficult to measure and track over time.  They are also often difficult to scale, as many blue carbon projects are often built around local communities. Therefore, scaling up conservation or restoration of a particular mangrove area would often have to involve working with different communities, she added.  Key to the institute would be to help people understand how important mangroves are for climate adaptation and mitigation.   Amazon will be providing the institute with a grant of up to US$3 million (S$4.1 million) to establish and fund its operations for the first three years, to help the region build and scale credible blue carbon projects.

86,"Switzerland: International Union for Conservation of Nature has issued the following press release: As part of the Great Blue Wall initiative, designed to accelerate ocean conservation and regenerative economic development in the Western Indian Ocean, IUCN and Blue Forest Company used the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon to announce a new blue carbon partnership, with work beginning in Mozambique. Both IUCN and Blue Forest Company will work towards “Sustainable Development and Biodiversity Conservation of mangrove forests in Mozambique, through effective implementation of the Ministry of Land and Environment of the Republic of Mozambique and IUCN ’ s programmes.' The partnership is designed to restore and preserve extensive tracts of mangrove forest financed through carbon credits where the majority of the net income generated over the multi-year project would be channelled to the local communities living alongside those mangrove forests. It also heralds a substantial mangrove reforestation programme as both a key defensive approach and profitable venture for tackling the many issues affecting a vast and sensitive area, and additionally forms part of the Western Indian Ocean Resilience & Prosperity Initiative (WIO RPI). This initiative helps deliver the UN ’ s Sustainable Development Goal 14 – Life Below Water (SDG 14) and many of the other inter-related SDG Goals. The announcement and signing of a memorandum of understanding was made at a joint High-Level Event during the UN Ocean Conference 2022, co-hosted by IUCN and Blue Forest Company, together with the Government of Seychelles, Danny Faure Foundation, UNECA, Nekton, WIOMSA and the UN COP27 High Level Climate Champions team. This event is part of the Regional blue dialogues and action: Initiatives and financing mechanisms catalysing the transition to an inclusive and sustainable blue economy in the Western Indian Ocean programme co-hosted by the Governments of Kenya and Mozambique. IUCN Director General Dr. Bruno Oberle commented: “Political leadership and financial support can be the catalyst for a self-sustaining regenerative blue economy that will empower the Western Indian Ocean region and its people. We ’ re actively seeking partnership initiatives such as the collaboration with Blue Forest that will scale-up ocean-based action, helping manage, protect, conserve and restore marine and coastal ecosystems, making fisheries sustainable and providing access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets. ” Vahid Fotuhi, Founder and CEO of Blue Forest, specialists in mangrove reforestation partnerships said: “this MOU is a watershed moment for us, coming as it does on the back of significant success in reforestation projects in Eastern and Southern Africa, in Mozambique and Kenya. In Mozambique our starter project is already restoring and preserving 185,000 hectares, alongside much sustainable job creation. These projects are just the start of an ambitious plan to truly reforest mangroves around the world, to restore balance to the environment and the communities which rely on the ecosystems there. ” Thomas Sberna, IUCN ’ s Eastern & Southern Africa ’ s Regional Head of Coastal and Ocean Resilience pointed to the many and diverse representatives in attendance as a signifier of the event ’ s importance, saying: “The event has been massively over-subscribed, which is an acknowledgement of how great this topic resonates with coastal and ocean communities around the world and the dire urgency for its solutions. ” Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Journal Code: INS Subject: CONSERVATION (92%); REFORESTATION (91%); BLUE ECONOMY (90%); BUSINESS NEWS (90%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS (90%); GREEN ECONOMY (90%); MARINE CONSERVATION (90%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (90%); OCEAN HEALTH (90%); OCEANS (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); BLUE GROWTH (89%); CIRCULAR ECONOMY (89%); COASTAL CONSERVATION (89%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (89%); OCEAN ECONOMY (89%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (89%); NATURAL RESOURCES (79%); BIODIVERSITY (78%); BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION (78%); COASTAL AREAS (78%); ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION (78%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (78%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS CONSERVATION (78%); SUSTAINABILITY (78%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (78%); SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES (78%); WETLANDS CONSERVATION (78%); FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (77%); SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY (77%); COMPANY PROFITS (74%); CARBON OFFSETS (73%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (73%); PRESS RELEASES (73%); JOB CREATION (72%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (69%); EXECUTIVES (67%); FISHING WORKERS (64%) Industry: FORESTRY & LOGGING (93%); REFORESTATION (91%); BLUE ECONOMY (90%); GREEN ECONOMY (90%); MARINE CONSERVATION (90%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (90%); BLUE GROWTH (89%); CIRCULAR ECONOMY (89%); FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENT (78%); FORESTS & WOODLANDS CONSERVATION (78%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (78%); SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES (78%); FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (77%); SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY (77%); CARBON OFFSETS (73%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (73%); FISHING WORKERS (64%) Person: DANNY FAURE (79%) Geographic: INDIAN OCEAN (92%); MOZAMBIQUE (95%); KENYA (92%); AFRICA (79%); EASTERN AFRICA (79%); SEYCHELLES (79%); SWITZERLAND (79%)"
87,"2023 APR 04 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily News -- Investigators discuss new findings in environmental protection. According to news originating from West Bengal, India, by NewsRx editors, the research stated, ""One of the most productive and supportive ecosystems, the mangroves, have faced a sharp decline of 1.04 million hectares globally, mostly due to population pressure and environmental changes related to the recent effects of global warming and climate change.""   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Vivekananda College: ""The loss of area, species migration, altered ecological services etc. are among the most discussed concerns, as evident from the volumes of literatures. However, these issues have overshadowed the fact that along with biodiversity, globally we are losing an important and efficient carbon sink - the mangrove lands. The lost mangrove patches and their conversion to aquaculture, agriculture, or simply settlement areas significantly alter the carbon budget. Sometimes conversion of mangroves to agriculture or aquaculture farms even reverses the roles and the sink has been reported to have become a source of carbon - alternatively known as blue carbon emission.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""This article provides an overview of the impacts of coastal aquacultures, particularly established in expense of mangrove lands and its consequence on global carbon budget. It has been observed that this globally predominant land use change practices not only significantly reduce the carbon sink capacity but also frequently act as indirect source of the same.""

88,"2023 APR 07 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- Data detailed on Climate Change have been presented. According to news reporting out of Burwood, Australia, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) include mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows, all of which are currently under threat, putting their contribution to mitigating climate change at risk. Although certain chal-lenges and trade-offs exist, remote sensing offers a promising avenue for transparent, replicable, and cost-effective accounting of many BCE at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales.""   Funders for this research include Australian Research Council, Alfred Deakin Fellowship scheme, Australian Research Council, I + D + i Projects, PIE HOLOCENO, European Commission, Michael E. Tennenbaum Secretarial Scholar, ICoAST program with collaborative funding from the University of Western Australia, Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australian Institute of Marine Science and Western Australian Department of Fisheries, Blue Carbon Capability Development Funding grant from the Australian Institute of Marine Science.   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Deakin University, ""The United Nations Frame-work Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has issued guidelines for developing blue carbon inventories to incorporate into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Yet, there is little guidance on remote sensing techniques for monitoring, reporting, and verifying blue carbon assets. This review constructs a unified roadmap for applying remote sensing technologies to develop cost-effective carbon inventories for BCE - from local to global scales. We summarise and discuss (1) current standard guidelines for blue carbon inventories; (2) tradi-tional and cutting-edge remote sensing technologies for mapping blue carbon habitats; (3) methods for trans-lating habitat maps into carbon estimates; and (4) a decision tree to assist users in determining the most suitable approach depending on their areas of interest, budget, and required accuracy of blue carbon assessment. We designed this work to support UNFCCC-approved IPCC guidelines with specific recommendations on remote sensing techniques for GHG inventories. Overall, remote sensing technologies are robust and cost-effective tools for monitoring, reporting, and verifying blue carbon assets and projects.""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""Increased appreciation of these tech-niques can promote a technological shift towards greater policy and industry uptake, enhancing the scalability of blue carbon as a Natural Climate Solution worldwide.""

89,"The following information was released by the World Bank: The World Bank's Board of Executive Directors approved a project to support the Government of Indonesia in enhancing the management of mangroves and livelihoods of local communities on May 20, 2022. The Mangroves for Coastal Resilience Project will focus on strengthening the policy and institutions for mangrove management and rehabilitation, promoting sustainable mangrove management, as well as improving the livelihood opportunities for Indonesian coastal communities living around mangrove forests in selected areas. ""The success of this project will contribute significantly to achieving Indonesia's emissions reduction target under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), as well as our target to turn forests and land use sector into a Net Sink by 2030. Mangroves restoration and conservation are critical to realize those targets and are testament to Indonesia's strong global commitment to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change"", conveyed Siti Nurbaya Bakar, Minister of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia. Spanning about 3.4 million hectares, Indonesia's mangroves account for over 20 percent of the global mangrove area and cover 40 of the 54 species of true mangroves currently recorded as the richest diversity in the world. Indonesia's mangroves store 3.14 billion tons of CO2 (commonly referred to as ""blue carbon"") or equivalent to GHG emissions from approximately 2.5 billion passenger vehicles driven for one year. Mangroves are a key component of livelihoods in coastal communities, providing important sources of food and income. About fifty-five percent of the total fish catch biomass in Indonesia consists of mangrove-dependent species, the total annual production of which is valued at US$825 million. Mangroves also have tourism value of almost US$30 million a year. Recent World Bank research suggests that mangroves have annual values from US$15,000 to almost US$50,000 per hectare in Indonesia. Given their significant value, Indonesian mangroves need to be rehabilitated. In the last 20 years, Indonesia lost approximately 13,000 hectares of mangroves every year (larger than the size of Paris), driven by indirect factors including global demand for products such as shrimp (which is often cultivated in areas which were mangrove before) as well as overall lack of perceived mangroves economic value. Coastal communities that depend on mangroves for their resilience and livelihoods are among the most vulnerable in Indonesia. They have limited access to services such as secondary schools, safe water, electricity, and transportation, and experience 1.27 percent higher poverty rate compared to communities living in non-coastal villages. Now with an extended COVID-19 imposed crisis, poverty rates are likely to increase emphasizing the need for targeted policies and investments to reach these coastal communities. ""We commend the bold steps taken by the Government of Indonesia to reverse mangrove losses and rehabilitate both degraded and deforested mangrove areas, and therefore stand to support those efforts. Conservation of Indonesia's healthy mangroves ecosystems and targeted rehabilitation using global best practices brings significant economic returns to the country in the forms of coastal resilience, fisheries productivity, tourism potential and climate mitigation. Through the project, the World Bank supports the country in promoting green, resilient, and inclusive development among coastal communities, including by strengthening national and sub-national institutions and policies managing mangroves and adding value to mangroves by enabling future payments for blue carbon contained in mangroves."", stated Satu Kahkonen, World Bank Country Director for Indonesia and Timor-Leste. ""By integrating sustainable resource management into village-level planning and increasing the role of women in mangrove management and village leadership, we expect to witness increased mangrove cover and reduce mangrove loss."" The project is designed to support the Government's National Mangrove Rehabilitation program that aims to rehabilitate 600,000 hectares of mangroves by 2024. Initially focused on four provinces that contain a significant portion of existing and degraded mangroves areas, namely East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, North Sumatra and Riau, the integrated conservation, rehabilitation and livelihood improvement model can be replicated throughout the country. The project is also supportive of the World Bank Group's Climate Action Plan (FY 2021-25) and Gender Strategy (FY 2016-23), particularly the strategic objectives related to economic opportunities and enhancing women's voice and agency.

90,"2023 MAR 14 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Life Science Daily -- Current study results on life sciences have been published. According to news reporting from Haryana, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, ""Sundarban is the world's largest mangrove wetland.""   The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from O.P. Jindal Global University: ""This study, conducted in 2016, to compare blue carbon sequestration with different natural metapopulations and a four-year-old Avicennia marina (30% area)- Rhizophora mucronata (70% area)-mixed mangrove plantation under anthropoganic stress. The aims of the study is to find out the variations in soil ecological function indicators (pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density, soil texture, available nitrogn, phosphorus and soil organic carbon) and key ecological service indicator (soil blue carbon pool) between sites. Simpson's Index of dominance, diversity and Shannon-Weiner Index revealed that all the sites are under ecological stress, with the Suaeda maritima -dominated mudflat having the least biodiversity. It is also revealed that pH and electrical conductivity were highest in Suaeda maritima and Phoenix padulosa -dominated metapopulations, whereas organic carbon was the highest under the mangrove plantation and Avicennia marina -dominated site. Available nitrogen was recorded highest in the community with the Sonneretia sp.- Avicennia marina association. The mixed mangrove plantation had the highest blue carbon pool.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""The species diversity was not found to be related with the distance from the nearby conserved mangrove forest, contrary to the island biogeography theory. This study concludes with a recommendation of mixed mangrove plantations to restore the degraded saline mudflats along the human settlements across the globe.""

91,"Twelve innovative solutions, projects and tools for blue carbon markets are getting technical support from Friends of Ocean Action and UpLink as part of the Blue Carbon Challenge. The Blue Carbon Challenge, an initiative from Friends of Ocean Action, UpLink and the Mangroves Working Group, has identified 12 projects that harness the potential of blue carbon to support ecosystem conservation, restoration and coastal management. The 12 organisations will receive technical support and valuable connections to scale their interventions and bring strong blue carbon credits to the market. Blue carbon carbon stored in aquatic ecosystems like mangrove forests and seagrass beds, has the potential to store five times as much carbon per square foot as terrestrial ecosystems. But to date, blue carbon markets and projects have been underdeveloped and underfunded. Investors need to expand the supply of high-quality blue carbon credits to make the most of this climate mitigation strategy. With this in mind, the Blue Carbon Challenge sought projects that could advance the conservation and restoration of coastal and aquatic ecosystems for the carbon market, as well as solutions that support and build trust and transparency in these projects. The Blue Carbon Challenge's top 12 innovators 1 Mikoko Pamoja CBO Mikoko Pamoja is a mangrove restoration project that is providing biodiversity, socioeconomic empowerment and climate mitigation services for communities in Kenya. The project sequesters 2,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year and generates an income of approximately $30,000. The revenue is reinvested in the local community to improve access to water, sanitation and education, as well as further environmental conservation. 2 Blue Ventures Blue Ventures is working with coastal communities to develop the Google Earth Engine Mangrove Mapping Methodology (GEM). GEM is an accessible, cloud-based tool that supports rapid monitoring of mangrove cover and historical land use change. Blue Ventures hopes that GEMs simple interface will help mangrove blue carbon initiatives get off the ground. 3 Friendship Bangladesh Friendship Bangladesh is led by Runa Khan, a social innovator with Schwab. Khan is developing a mangrove plantation and livelihood diversification initiative to help protect climate-vulnerable communities in Bangladesh. The groups work has already yielded a 63 percent increase in incomes and created 75 women-led mangrove forest protection groups. 4 Distributed Additive Manufacturing (DAM) and Worldview Impact Foundation This partnership aims to deploy a factory in a shipping container in Gambia, enabling the conversion of ocean-bound plastic waste into reusable and fully recyclable seedling incubators to increase the survival rate of mangrove plantings. 5 The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in Latin America TNC is hosting two blue conservation programmes in Belize and Mexico. In Belize, the group is piloting Blue Carbon Resilience Credits (BCRC) that will attract buyers willing to offset carbon emissions with third party-verified metrics of carbon and flood reduction benefits. The Belize project will piggyback off of TNCs experience in Mexico and incorporate restoration projects into its policy. 6 ReforestAction together with Yagasu This partnership is using ReforestActions crowdplanting digital platform to connect several villages as they restore degraded mangrove forests in Sumatra. Since 2017, the group has helped 770,000 new mangrove seedlings take root. Theyre aiming to plant 1 million more by the end of 2023. 7 Kelp Forest Foundation The Kelp Forest Foundation wants to prove that kelp can provide ecosystem and carbon sink services. They are supporting emerging independent research that quantifies the carbon sequestration and biodiversity-building potential of giant kelp. 8 Distant Imagery Solutions Distant Imagery Solutions creates drones from simple and scalable 3D-printed components and pairs them with precision planting to help restore mangroves. Their drones can drop 2,000 germinated seeds, or 500 seedballs, in 10 minutes. 9 Silvestrum Climate Associates Silvestrum has partnered with Verra and other partners to develop the Seascape Carbon Initiative (SCI). The SCIs goal is to unlock the potential for coastal and marine activities that could generate significant and verifiable climate values. The group is investing in ocean carbon drawdown by expanding seascapes and ecosystems that include wild and farmed seaweeds, marine protected areas and seabed restoration. 10 The Ocean Foundation The Ocean Foundation has partnered with the Mexican Commission for Protected Areas (CONANP) and multiple Mexican universities to build coastal resilience in Xcalak Reefs National Park. Their projects goal is to enhance coastal resilience through seascape restoration including dunes, seagrasses, mangroves and corals. As a long-term objective, the group wants to sell blue carbon credits to generate resilient income streams for the local indigenous community. 11 Yayasan IKAMaT Yasan IKAMat developed Mangrove Tag, an online mangrove mapping platform. Mangrove tag facilitates monitoring patrols and in-field reporting on the condition of mangrove ecosystems with community participation. It also collects metadata on species, damage, planting and tourism. 12 Solon Capital Partners Solon established the Africa Conservation Initiative (ACI) to help conserve an restore the Sherbo River Estuary (SRE) in Sierra Leone The project promotes conservation by selling carbon credits and developing alternative livelihoods for local communities. The ACI is using its deep ties with indigenous communities to achieve its dual aims of conversation and development.

92,"In observance of World Water Day today, Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda underscored the importance of developing sustainable water management and renewed her call for safeguarding the resilience of the country's water resources as a global water crisis challenges the world. ""Water is life, and it affects everyone. As the theme for the observance of World Water Day this year implies, we must accelerate change. This means that we must increase our efforts to save our water resources and ensure a sufficient water supply for present and future generations,"" Legarda stated. Legarda is a known champion of the environment. She has been pushing for community and government initiatives to minimize the risk of the country's water resources to run dry, such as reusing wastewater for irrigation, rehabilitation of watersheds through reforestation, and protection of mangrove soils. She also emphasized the significance of every individual's actions in saving water and protecting resources. ""Small changes can go a long way. Starting from our homes and workplaces, we can protect and save our water by changing how we use and consume it. There are a lot of simple and easy ways to conserve water, and we must stop disposing pollutants to our rivers,"" Legarda said. In 2004, Republic Act No. 9275, or the Philippine Clean Water Act, which Legarda authored, was enacted. The law aims to protect the country's water bodies from pollution from land-based sources and by penalizing acts of polluting them. It also provides for establishing multi-sectoral governing boards that manage water quality in local river bodies and other water resources. Legarda has urged the government, as well, to consider investing in blue carbon initiatives through the sustainable management of marine resources and marine-linked sectors, which are also vital for climate change adaptation along the coasts. Last March 14, she filed Senate Bill No. 1993, or the Blue Economy Act, which seeks to adopt the blue economy as a framework for sustainable, safe use and development of marine wealth within the country's Maritime Zones. The proposed measure aims to protect and conserve the health and resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems and habitats to promote the well-being, prosperity, and security of present and future generations of Filipinos. ""The country's coastal resources have always been a reliable source of water and food for many Filipinos. Thus, we need to invest in blue carbon initiatives that will help protect our coral reefs, seagrass beds, lush mangrove forests, and other coastal and marine sources,"" Legarda said. ""Let us work together to restore the ecological integrity of our bodies of water,"" she urged. The World Meteorological Organization estimates that around 3.6 billion people worldwide struggle to have access to sufficient and clean water. Co-hosted by the Netherlands and Tajikistan, leaders and stakeholders from countries around the globe are gathering this week in New York City, USA for the United Nation's 2023 Water Conference. The forum seeks better outcomes and solutions on all water-related challenges to fast-track the delivery of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, specifically ensuring sustainable water management for all.

93," The blessing and inauguration of the Batangas City Mangrove Conservation Ecopark located in Sitio 3, Brgy. Malitam in this city on the 11th of October.?  Led by Mayor Beverley Rose Dimacuha and 5th District Rep. Marvey Marino is this project of the City Environment and Natural Resources Office (City ENRO) that aims to preserve and protect nature to prevent any adverse effects of calamities such as flooding, landslides and others.?  According to City Environment Officer Oliver Gonzales, mangroves help absorb water while its leaves filter pollution. He said, mangroves store 10 times more carbon than forests. ??  The mangrove root acts as a blue carbon sink, it absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and stores it in its roots, branches and soil, said Gonzales.  This mangrove ecopark has an area of ??6,500 square meters, and there is a 500 meter long eco trail (bamboo walk) here. It has seven (7) types of mangroves, such as Bakauan-babae, Bakauan lalaki, Pototan, Busain, Bungalon, Bakhaw-bato and Pagatpat, and 12 types or species of birds have been identified here, including the Eurasian tree sparrow , Scaly-breasted munia, Chestnut munia, Olive-backed sunbird, Golden-bellied gerygone, Black-naped oriole and others.  Mayor Dimacuha said that the said mangrove ecopark is an eco-tourism site that will provide many economic activities in the area.  I hope you can protect and keep it clean, dont litter it and instead expand the mangrove area, Mayor Dimacuha asked the residents.  He said, even now there are many people who want to visit here, so the residents should have entrepreneurial skills to earn money. According to Cong. Mario, mangroves are very important because fish spawn here.  This is a proof that despite the continuous entry of industrial investment into the city, it continues to protect our nature. The construction of the dike that can serve as a tourist attraction in the area and the rehabilitation plan of the Calumpang River to become a full-fledged tourist destination are also continuing, said Marino.

94," 27 October 2021 (Antara News) The Indonesian government has set an ambitious target of restoring 600 thousand hectares of mangrove forests across the country by 2024. The world's largest archipelagic country sees the preservation of mangrove forests as crucial because of their role in providing habitats for aquatic and terrestrial fauna and flora, protection from strong winds and waves, soil stabilization and erosion prevention, nutrient retention and water quality improvement through filtration of sediments and pollutants, flood mitigation, sequestration of carbon dioxide, and protection of associated marine ecosystems. As high carbon storage ecosystems, mangrove and peatland ecosystems play a strategic role as nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Peatlands and mangroves store up to 2 to 10 times more carbon than forests. Given the significant role of mangrove and peatland ecosystems, the government has recently converted the Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) into Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM). Mangroves, however, have been disappearing more quickly than inland tropical rainforests, particularly due to clear-cutting for shrimp farms. The loss of mangroves has led to a decline in fisheries, degradation of clean water supply, salinization of coastal soils, erosion and land subsidence, as well as an increase in gas emissions, among other things. President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), while visiting Tana Tidung district, North Kalimantan province, on October 19, 2021 had revealed that the country's existing mangrove forests covered a total area of 3.6 million hectares. Rehabilitation efforts are being undertaken to protect coastal areas from sea waves, seawater intrusion, and preserve the habitat of species, including birds, fishes, crabs, monkeys, and other flora and fauna, living in and around the mangrove forests, according to him. Accompanied by several foreign ambassadors, Widodo planted mangrove trees in North Kalimantan as part of the mangrove restoration program. The program's funds were derived from various sources, including state and regional budgets, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs of private and state-owned companies, and the community in general, he noted. Earlier, the President had called on regional governments to take a cue from the model of mangrove rehabilitation at Bali's Ngurah Rai Forest Park. Accompanied by the Minister of Environment and Forestry, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, he, on October 8, 2021, visited the forest park to review the implementation of mangrove planting activities. ""We will continue to do this in coastal areas to restore and preserve our mangrove forest areas and also to anticipate and mitigate impacts of global climate change,"" he remarked. The Ngurah Rai Forest Park, which was developed in 2003, is a pilot project for mangrove rehabilitation efforts that combines education and tourism. The park is administratively located in Tanjung Benoa and its surroundings in Kuta and South Kuta sub-districts, Badung district (covering an area of 627 hectares), and in Serangan Island, South Denpasar sub-district, Denpasar city (spanning an area of 746.50 hectares). The mangrove park has abundant natural beauty and biodiversity including bird species, and aquatic species, such as fish, mollusks, and shrimps. The government has emphasized that efforts to control the effects of climate change in the marine and coastal sectors are highly dependent on coastal and marine conservation since coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and seagrasses, can store and produce carbon, which is better known as blue carbon. Blue carbon is currently considered an important ecosystem since it can absorb greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, Indonesia has vast blue carbon potential on account of the presence of about 3.3 million hectares of mangroves that can store 950 tCO2e of carbon per hectare and about three million hectares of seagrass beds that can store 119.5 tCO2e of carbon per hectare. Hence, the Environment and Forestry Ministry is continuing to encourage the inclusion of blue carbon in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) document considering its potential to store carbon, according to the ministry's director general of climate change control, Laksmi Dwanthi. NDC is an emission reduction contribution document that reflects the commitment of each state party in the Paris Agreement, she explained. Indonesia's blue carbon potential can be found in its large marine area, which contains 23 percent of the world's mangroves ecosystem, she noted. ""It is a very significant area related to the potential carbon absorption, not only in Indonesia but also at the global level,"" she said. Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya as well as Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono have held discussions with experts on assessing how far Indonesia can include the blue carbon potential in the context of climate change mitigation, she added. In the context of adaptation, the ministry has taken various steps and programs to make the policy mainstream, especially in coastal areas, for instance by implementing the Climate Village Program, she informed. In addition, Indonesia has cooperated with other archipelagic countries--Fiji and Costa Rica--to submit a proposal to integrate marine aspects in climate change issues at the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in 2019, she added. Minister Nurbaya Bakar launched the 2021 National Mangrove Map on October 13, 2021 for the preservation of the country's mangrove forest area. The latest data from the National Mangrove Map shows that Indonesia has 3,364,080 hectares of mangroves, an increase of 52,873 hectares from 3,311,207 hectares in 2013-2019. In the 3,364,080 hectares of mangrove land, there are variations in canopy classification from good to sparse, the minister said. Concerning mangrove lands with sparse canopy to damaged canopy, the government is targeting to recover around 600 thousand hectares by 2024, she added. Nurbaya reaffirmed the government's commitment to mangrove preservation efforts by successfully transforming fishponds into mangrove ecosystems again. As for the 2021 mangrove rehabilitation program's target of restoring 34 thousand hectares of mangroves, the BRGM is upbeat that it can be achieved. Head of BRGM, Hartono, said that the agency will continue to plant mangroves in nine provinces: North Sumatra, Bangka Belitung, Riau Islands, Riau, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, Papua, and West Papua. ""In order to expedite mangrove rehabilitation, we are also involving local residents through the labor-intensive method, so that the mangrove planting target can quickly be achieved,"" he informed. The government hopes that the program will benefit people by improving their standard of living and purchasing power, thus making them prosperous. In addition, the program is also expected to support efforts to accelerate economic recovery post-COVID-19.

95,"2022 AUG 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily News -- Current study results on ecosystem health and sustainability have been published. According to news reporting out of Xiamen University by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Sequestration of blue carbon (C) in mangrove plantations depends on site characteristics and plantation management.""   Financial supporters for this research include Fundamental Research Funds For The Central Universities; The Scientific And Technological Research Project For Social Welfare of Zhongshan City of China.   Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Xiamen University: ""This study evaluated the effects of plantation management on C sequestration at a C-neutral site in Xiamen, China. A field study was conducted on 10-year-old Sonneratia apetala and Kandelia obovata plantations (mono-Sa, mono-Ko) and a 15-year-old mixed plantation (mix-SK). We found that mono-Ko had a significantly higher ecosystem C sequestration rate (3.32±0.62 kg C m-2 yr-1) than others when planted in the indirect shade of pioneer species. As a non-native species, Sonneratia performed better (0.57±0.01 kg C m-2 yr-1) when planted with Kandelia than in monotypic plantations. The temporary and long-term certified emission reduction (tCER and lCER) of the mono-Ko was 17876.74 and 16089.07 net CO2-e, respectively, making up 59.32% and 58.48% of the total tCER and lCER of the plantation site. A literature review was conducted to show the compatibility of this study with other natural and plantation sites of China and Bangladesh (the native habitat for Sonneratia).""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""The C sequestration of Sonneratia plantation sites in China is comparable (0.086%) with those in Bangladesh. However, the soil C accumulation rate for a Sonneratia monotypic plantation in Bangladesh decreased with age, yet the same did not occur in the plantations of China.""

97,"2022 AUG 12 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Science Daily -- Investigators discuss new findings in marine science. According to news originating from Beihai, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""Mangroves are considered to be a sink for microplastics (MPs) due to their unique characteristics.""   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Ministry of Natural Resources: ""Previous studies mainly focused on the spatial distribution of MPs, but few researchers have addressed the influence of tidal variation on this distribution, especially since the MP total number in mangroves was unknown. In this study, surface sediment samples were collected in mangroves from the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea, and the abundance, composition, and number of MPs were investigated. The results showed that MPs were widely present in all mangrove sediment samples, with abundances ranging from 26.67 ± 9.43 to 239.94 ± 37.80 items/kg. The distribution of MPs was heterogeneous among different sampling sites, with the highest levels in the Shankou (SK) area. The MP abundance in the same mangrove forest gradually increased from the low tidal zone to the high tidal zone, with the enrichment factor ranging from 1.50 to 4.00. The MP abundance was significantly correlated with particulate organic carbon (POC) (n = 12, R = 0.664, p < 0.05).""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Results showed that mangroves had an interception effect on MPs and factors affecting MP distribution in mangrove sediments included not only tides but also human activities, such as aquaculture, agriculture, and residential life. Finally, this paper estimated the MP total number in mangroves at different sampling areas and tidal zones, and the middle tidal zone was considered to be more accurate for MP pollution assessment in mangroves.""

98,"2022 OCT 10 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at NewsRx Science Daily -- Researchers detail new data in geography. According to news reporting originating from the University Gadjah Mada by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""Mangroves can store carbon effectively with a value of about 1,023 Mg C/Ha and become one of the richest forests that store 4-20 billion tons of blue carbon globally. Remote sensing imagery can be used to map mangrove surface carbon stocks using radar and optical image sensors.""   Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from University Gadjah Mada: ""Generally, forest carbon on earth is stored in two places, namely above the surface (Above Ground Carbon, AGC) and below the surface (Below Ground Carbon, BGC). This study aims to estimate the surface carbon stock of mangroves using multisensory imagery using the Random Forest method in the Clungup Mangrove Conservation (CMC) area, Malang Regency, East Java. Four vegetation indices (IRECI, NDI45, NDVI, SAVI), single band, and VV VH polarization were used as predictive variables. Estimating the carbon stock mangrove value using Sentinel-1 imagery produced 2,126 tons of C with R² 0.11. Meanwhile, Sentinel-2 produces an estimated carbon value of 2,025 tons C with an R² of 0.22. The estimation model using Sentinel-2 shows a better evaluation value with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.89 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.75.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""The IRECI vegetation index is the most important variable in estimating carbon stocks. The results of the mapping accuracy of the Sentinel-1 model show a value of 34.73% and Sentinel-2 35.03%.""

99,"2023 FEB 20 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Biotech News Daily -- New study results on climate change have been published. According to news reporting originating from Srinagar, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""Blue carbon has made significant contributions to climate change adaptation and mitigation while assisting in achieving co-benefits such as aquaculture development and coastal restoration, winning international recognition.""   The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Department of Higher Education: ""Climate change mitigation and co-benefits from blue carbon ecosystems are highlighted in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. Its diverse nature has resulted in unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, with conservationists, academics, and politicians working together to achieve common goals such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, which need proper policy regulations, funding, and multi-prong and multi-dimensional strategies to deal with. An overview of blue carbon habitats such as seagrass beds, mangrove forests, and salt marshes, the critical role of blue carbon ecosystems in mitigating plastic/micro-plastic pollution, as well as the utilization of the above-mentioned blue carbon resources for biofuel production, are critically presented in this research. It also highlights the concerns about blue carbon habitats. Identifying and addressing these issues might help preserve and enhance the ocean's ability to store carbon and combat climate change and mitigate plastic/micro-plastic pollution. Checking out their role in carbon sequestration and how they act as the major carbon sinks of the world are integral parts of this study.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""In light of the global frameworks for blue carbon and the inclusion of microalgae in blue carbon, blue carbon ecosystems must be protected and restored as part of carbon stock conservation efforts and the mitigation of plastic/micro-plastic pollution. When compared to the ecosystem services offered by terrestrial ecosystems, the ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems, such as the sequestration of carbon, the production of biofuels, and the remediation of pollution, among other things, are enormous. The primary purpose of this research is to bring awareness to the extensive range of beneficial effects that can be traced back to ecosystems found in coastal environments.""

100,"2023 MAR 27 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Information Technology Daily -- Investigators publish new report on information technology. According to news reporting out of Dalian, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Mangroves are an important source of blue carbon that grow in coastal areas. The study of mangrove species distribution is the basis of carbon storage research.""   Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key Research And Development Program of China; National High Resolution Special Research.   Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Dalian Polytechnic University: ""In this study, we explored the potential of combining optical (Gaofen-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-9) and fully polarized synthetic aperture radar data from different periods (Gaofen-3) to distinguish mangrove species in the Fucheng town of Leizhou, Guangdong Province. The Gaofen-1 data were fused with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 satellite data, respectively. The new data after fusion had both high spatial and spectral resolution. The backscattering coefficient and polarization decomposition parameters of the fully polarized SAR data which could characterize the canopy structure of mangroves were extracted. Ten different feature combinations were designed by combining the two types of data. The extremely randomized trees algorithm (ERT) was used to classify the species, and the optimal feature subset was selected by the feature selection algorithm on the basis of the ERT, and the importance of the features was sorted. Studies show the following: (1) When controlling a single variable, the higher the spatial resolution of the multi-spectral data, the higher the interspecific classification accuracy. (2) The coupled Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 data with a 2 m resolution will have higher classification accuracy than a single data source. (3) The selected feature subset contains all types of features in the optical data and the polarization decomposition features of the SAR data from different periods: multi-spectral band > texture feature > polarization decomposition parameter > vegetation index. Among the optimized feature combinations, the classification accuracy of mangrove species was the highest, the overall classification accuracy was 90.13%, and Kappa was 0.84, indicating that multi-source and SAR data from different periods coupling could improve the discrimination of mangrove species.""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""(4) The ERT classification algorithm is suitable for the study of mangrove species classification, and the classification accuracy of extremely random trees in this paper is higher than that of random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Bayesian (Bayes). The results can provide technical guidance and data support for mangrove species monitoring based on multi-source satellite data.""

101,"2023 JAN 26 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- Research findings on Science - Marine Science are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting originating from Bangkok, Thailand, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""Mangrove forest is a blue-carbon-rich ecosystem and source of greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. Recent studies of GHG fluxes have been limited for inventory baseline in Thailand.""   Financial supporters for this research include Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI), National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT).   Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Kasetsart University, ""Three GHG emissions were investigated for different mangrove establishment and managements in Ranong province; natural rehabilitation, reforestation, and primary undisturbed forests, due to their differences in carbon and nutrient input as a result of natural and human-induced management. The static closed-chamber technique was used to collected gas sample from soil and water surface interface throughout the year. Total highest GHG emissions were found in the primary undisturbed site (15.40 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), compared to the reforestation and natural rehabilitation sites (12.60 and 8.53 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), respectively. The mean average of GHG fluxes at soil-air interface for three mangrove sites were 2.59 +/- 0.94 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 3.86 +/- 2.01 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and 2.09 +/- 1.59 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1). Whereas at water-air interface, GHG fluxes were 1.66 +/- 0.66 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 2.47 +/- 1.47 mu mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and 2.74 +/- 1.06 mu mol N2O m(-2) h(-1). The undisturbed and reforested sites with good conservation, enriched organic matters and nitrogen nutrients, and large mature trees had significantly higher CO2 emission. CH4 fluxes had significantly higher in the natural rehabilitation site with well growing stage and dominant in low-elevated area with longer inundation periods. Whereas N2O emissions were not statistically different among three mangrove sites. GHG fluxes were recorded higher in soil surface during wet season and rainfall was significantly correlated to CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions.""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""Additionally, the results would be useful in improving mangrove conservation and restoration strategy for GHG emission mitigation and developing an inventory baseline and more accurately estimating of GHG emissions from different mangroves in Thailand.""

102,"Scope :  The purpose of this Technical Cooperation (TC) is to implement a monitoring verification and reporting (MRV) system for mangrove ecosystems that provides a science-based data platform on the sequestration and release of blue carbon in participant countries. In 2019, the IDB, with support from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), established the ""UK Blue Carbon Fund"" (the Fund) to finance projects that will help reduce climate change's negative impacts increasing carbon sequestration.  The regional MRV is to be used to help monitor the progress of the projects that are to be implemented under the Fund. With this MRV system, the blue carbon projects of the Fund will be able to: (i) Improve the valuation of ecosystem services provided by mangrove ecosystems; (ii) Potentially include blue carbon data in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) schemes, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) programs, UNFCCC National Communications and carbon markets programs; (iii) Utilize an MRV system for results-based payments under a reforestation program. There is a growing trend to support or encourage results-based actions for reforestation, conservation, or reduced deforestation efforts. To effectively participate in or take advantage of these types of efforts, a key element of the results-based payment scheme will be a fully functional MRV.

103," The federal government is to provide almost $3 million to help restore and enhance 12,400 hectares of mangroves and saltmarsh habitats north of Adelaide.  The project aims to restore natural tidal flows thereby improving the ecological health of local ecosystems.  It will also enhance so called blue carbon storage, providing climate and biodiversity benefits and offering local farmers a new income stream through the growing carbon offset market.  Blue carbon, the carbon stored in coastal ecosystems, is of growing interest among scientists and policymakers worldwide as an important tool in mitigating climate change.  Mangroves, seagrasses, and saltmarshes line stretches of coastlines globally, absorbing and storing carbon at concentrations up to five times greater than terrestrial forests.  This carbon can remain in the sediment for thousands of years, making it a long-term natural solution to climate change.  The mangrove restoration project will be led by The Nature Conservancy Australia group and managing director Alison Rowe said South Australia's coastal wetlands offered significant opportunities to advance a blue carbon economy.  ?Around the world, we?re seeing just how important these ecosystems are to reducing emissions and protecting coastal communities who are among the most vulnerable to climate impacts,"" she said.  ""This project can serve as a model for future blue carbon projects here in Australia, and on the global stage.?  The project area also provides critically important habitat for many Australian and migratory shorebirds.  Around 15,000 birds gather in the mangroves for up to six months each year before migrating to breeding grounds in China, Siberia and elsewhere in east Asia.  Expanding the habitat available along the SA coast will strengthen global conservation efforts along one of the world?s great migratory bird flight paths, the project partners said.

104,"BASE CARBON INC (""BCBN-V;BCBNF-0"") - Selected by Danish Red Cross as Partner on Blue Carbon Projects Base Carbon Inc. (""Base Carbon"", or the ""Company""), has entered a letter of intent (LOI) with the Danish Red Cross to scope and assess Blue Carbon reduction projects in Southeast Asia. Highlights: //st * Base Carbon signs Letter of Intent with Danish Red Cross to develop blue carbon projects in Southeast Asia * Scope includes mangrove projects in Southeast Asia, an initial project in Philippines is in the scoping phase * Additional members of the Red Cross Movement are anticipated to be involved in the partnership, with potential to expand * Terms of the agreement include a 24-month term * 83% of the global carbon cycle is circulated through the ocean and coastal habitats cover less than 2% of the total ocean area accounting for 50% of the total carbon sequestered in ocean sediments Base Carbon Inc., through its subsidiary Base Carbon Capital Partners Corp, has entered into a letter of intent with the Danish Red Cross to scope and assess and potentially develop one or more mangrove-related carbon reduction projects in Southeast Asia which are anticipated to follow VERRA Tidal Wetland and Seagrass, methodology. The parties have committed to work together until at least October 2024 with respect to such potential projects in the region. The Danish Red Cross are recognized innovators in designing investment and underwriting structures related to the commercialization of carbon, climate and social benefit projects. Potential projects related to the prospective partnership will be jointly funded by the Danish Red Cross including other Red Cross affiliated entities. The parties anticipate that any project will be insured by Dunant Re IC Limited, an insurance company established by the Danish Red Cross and Replexus. The Company anticipates providing regular updates as the parties work together. This partnership is consistent with Base Carbons mandate to work with leading organizations on carbon projects with strong economics and social benefit additionalities. The Red Cross Movement, with its scale and breadth is ideally suited to execute carbon reduction and removal projects. Base will invest and contribute technology to materialize these projects, stated Philip Hardwick, COO of Base Carbon. Blue Carbon and Mangrove Carbon Projects Blue carbon refers to the carbon captured by ocean and coastal habitats such as seagrass meadows, whale habitats and mangroves, which act as robust sinks by sequestering and storing large amounts of carbon in both the plants and sediments below. By the numbers, 83% of the global carbon cycle is circulated through the ocean and coastal habitats cover less than 2% of the total ocean area but account for 50% of the total carbon sequestered in ocean sediments. By comparison, these habitats store two to four times more carbon than terrestrial forests making them a key component of nature-based solutions to climate change and effecting in helping corporations achieve their net zero commitments. In addition to acting as powerful carbon sequestration properties, mangrove projects mitigate the impacts of natural disasters, prevent erosion, and help reestablish fish and other marine life habitats. In addition to acting as natural carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) agents, mangroves also serve as a natural barrier against the effects of hurricanes and as habitats for species that are crucial to the ecological and economic health of coastal communities. Despite their numerous benefits, these ecosystems are experiencing rapid degradation from anthropogenic activities and climate change at a worrying rate, transforming their impressive capture capabilities into climate liabilities: When mangrove forests are cleared and destroyed, they release massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon Sequestration and Socio-Economic Benefits of the Projects Beyond carbon storage benefits, ecological restoration projects improve ecosystem services and enhance biodiversity increase. These initiatives benefit local communities' climate resilience, improve soil for stronger food systems and help restore microbial relationships to protect human health. Southeast Asia has one of the largest and most diverse mangroves habitats, but its continuing deforestation and degradation of natural forest areas is creating a complex situation with both local and global ramifications. The Red Cross will help implement social development programs for improving the quality of life of coastal communities, who will be involved in all stages of the projects and will be trained to carry out the restoration work. The Red Cross will help ensure the long-term sustainability of these social impacts by promoting the interrelated aspects that mangroves can bring to local communities: source of income and food for local populations, breeding grounds to support fisheries, protection from natural calamities, improvement of the water quality, promotion of ethical tourism, etc. During a recent due diligence visit, Base Carbon members engaged in consultation meetings with local people and evaluated the condition of the damaged mangroves within the project's targeted area.

107,"2023 MAR 02 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Chemicals & Chemistry Daily Daily -- New research on Science is the subject of a report. According to news reporting originating in Coffs Harbour, Australia, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, ""Coastal blue carbon habitats perform many important environmental functions, including long-term carbon and anthropogenic contaminant storage. Here, we analysed twenty-five Pb-dated mangrove, saltmarsh, and seagrass sediment cores from six estuaries across a land-use gradient to determine metal, metalloid, and phosphorous sedimentary fluxes.""   The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Southern Cross University, ""Cadmium, arsenic, iron, and manganese had linear to exponential positive correlations between concentrations, sediment flux, geoaccumulation index, and catchment development. Increases in anthropogenic development (agricultural or urban land uses) from >30 % of the total catchment area enhanced mean concentrations of arsenic, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc between 1.5 and 4.3-fold. A ~ 30 % anthropogenic land-use was the threshold in which blue carbon sediment quality begins to be detrimentally impacted on an entire estuary scale. Fluxes of phosphorous, cadmium, lead, and aluminium responded similarly, increasing 1.2 to 2.5-fold when anthropogenic land-use increased by at least 5 %. Exponential increases in phosphorus flux to estuary sediments seem to precede eutrophication as observed in more developed estuaries.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Overall, multiple lines of evidence revealed how catchment development drives blue carbon sediment quality across a regional scale.""   This research has been peer-reviewed.   For more information on this research see: Land use change increases contaminant sequestration in blue carbon sediments.

108,"2022 NOV 04 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily News -- Current study results on ecology have been published. According to news reporting out of Haikou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""As the world's largest reactive carbon reservoir, the ocean plays a critical role in global climate change.""   Funders for this research include National Social Science Found of China.   Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Hainan University: ""Among coastal plant ecosystems, mangroves have the highest carbon storage efficiency and are prone to the impact of anthropogenic activities. In this study, taking the mangrove wetland of Qinglan Bay as an example, we extracted information on mangrove coastal surface change from 1988 to 2020 based on multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing data through field ground surveys and laboratory analysis and used the InVEST model to calculate the spatial and temporal structure of blue carbon in the mangrove area to investigate the effects of mangrove change in an ecological restoration context. The result shows that the overall area of mangrove forests exhibited a decreasing trend from 1988 to 2020, and the area of mangroves decreased from 1559.34 ha to 737.37 ha of which 52.71% was transformed into aquiculture, construction, and farm land. Accordingly, the mangrove carbon sinks from 1988 to 2020 were significantly reduced and the carbon stock decreased at an annual tendency from 1,025,901.71 tons to 712,118.69 tons. With the implementation of mangrove restoration, the decline of mangrove forests has decreased since 2003, promoting the stabilization and enhancement of carbon sinks in the mangrove wetlands of Qinglan Bay.""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""The results of this study provide a technical method to evaluate the carbon sink contribution of mangrove wetland restoration in Hainan Province, a scientific basis and methodological innovation to monitor the carbon sink of mangrove cover change in larger regions of China, a theoretical basis to select criteria for mangrove restoration, and a scientific and systematic management strategy for ecological and mangrove restoration on Hainan Island.""

109,"2023 MAR 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- Research findings on climate change are discussed in a new report. According to news reporting originating from the Chinese Academy of Sciences by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""Mangroves occur in coastal intertidal zones and play an important role in terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. Accurate estimations of mangrove carbon stocks and sequestration potential can help quantify the contribution of mangroves to addressing climate change and achieving carbon neutrality goals.""   Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Chinese Academy of Sciences: ""The carbon stocks and burial rates of different mangrove communities and regions in Guangdong Province were studied through literature collection and data integration. The soil carbon densities of the Rhizophora stylosa and Bruguiera gymnorhiza communities were 0.27 and 0.23 Gg C/hm2, respectively, while the soil carbon density of the Kandelia obovata community was the lowest at only 0.13 Gg C/hm2. The area of mangroves in Guangdong Province is 9,106.2 hm2, the total carbon stock is 1,542.02 Gg C, and the soil carbon density is 0.23 Gg C/hm2. The total carbon reserves of mangroves in thirteen regions are in the following order: Zhanjiang (894.5 Gg C) > Yangjiang (195.4 Gg C) > Jiangmen (97.7 Gg C) > Zhuhai (91.0 Gg C) > Maoming (59.6 Gg C) > Shantou (51.4 Gg C) > Zhongshan (49.2 Gg C) > Huizhou (36.1 Gg C) > Guangzhou (35.1 Gg C) > Shenzhen (18.3 Gg C) > Shanwei (10.8 Gg C) > Dongguan (2.83 Gg C) > Chaozhou (0.11 Gg C). Using the 210Pb method, the sediment accretion rate was found to be 13.47 mm/a. Qi'ao Island had the highest sediment compaction rate of 31.5 mm/a, followed by Zhenhai Bay, with 16.5 mm/a, Shenzhen Futian, with 15.9 mm/a, and Leizhou Bay, with the lowest sediment compaction rate of 7.3 mm/a. The carbon sequestration capacity of Guangdong province is approximately 2.96 Gg C/a, with the Leizhou Peninsula having the highest (6.05 Gg C/a) and Futian, Shenzhen having the lowest (0.66 Gg C/a) capacities. The carbon storage of mangroves in Guangdong Province was 1,542.02 Gg C, which was higher than that in other regions. The carbon sequestration capacity of the mangroves was relatively strong.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Therefore, the protection and restoration of local mangroves may substantially contribute to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a provincial scale, provides insights into blue carbon sequestration capacity, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of blue carbon management.""

110,"2022 NOV 07 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily News -- Data detailed on environmental science have been presented. According to news reporting out of Qingdao, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""With the development of marine economy and climate changing, the ecological value of mangrove ecosystem has become increasingly prominent.""   Funders for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Natural Resources of The People's Republic of China.   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Ocean University of China: ""In this study, the ecological values of China's mangrove ecosystem services was evaluated based on the four services and nine functions of mangrove ecosystem. On this basis, the dynamic changing characteristics of the nine mangrove ecological values from 2001 to 2019 were analyzed. The results indicated that the top four service values were that of preventing coastal erosion, raw material supply, regulating water resources, and regulating climate and maintaining air quality. Significant changes were found in China's mangrove areas which increased during 2001-2013 and decreased during 2013-2019, while the unit area value of mangrove ecosystem services generally showed an upward trend. Subsequently, the evaluation results were applied to mangrove asset management with balance sheets, ecological compensation standard determination, and carbon trading in blue carbon sink.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""Based on the above analysis, the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions were proposed for mangrove protection and value application to guide effective management on mangroves and further to realize a higher ecological value of mangrove ecosystem.""

111,"2023 JAN 10 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- Investigators publish new report on Global Warming and Climate Change. According to news reporting out of Xiamen, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""The large amounts of organic carbon buried in mangrove wetlands are well recognized, but the lateral dissolved carbon export and greenhouse gas (GHGs) outgassing are often overlooked. In this study, we carried out seasonal observations of dissolved carbon and GHGs in an estuarine mangrove wetland with high input of riverine nitrogen in southeast China in 2019-2020.""   Financial support for this research came from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Xiamen University, ""The results showed that the tidal range and season were the two main factors controlling the lateral dissolved carbon export including total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The positive correlations between the average offsets of DIC, TA, DOC and tidal range confirmed the hydrological controls on the exchange of dissolved carbon between the mangrove creek and the estuary. The seasonal variability in temperature, groundwater export and freshwater input resulted in a larger carbon offset during low tidal range in spring and a smaller offset during high tidal range in fall. The mangrove creek acted as a net source of DIC, DOC, TA and GHGs. When the emissions of GHGs were calculated as CO2-equivalents, the average emission of CO2 was four times higher than that of N2O and the average emission of N2O was six times higher than that of CH4. In contrast with pristine mangroves, denitrification in mangrove wetlands with high input of riverine nitrogen played a crucial role in mineralization processes, leading to the production of DIC, TA and N2O. These biogeochemical processes may not be conducive to the blue carbon sequestration in mangrove soils.""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""These findings suggested that there are mutual benefits between the reduced loss of blue carbon and the mitigation of eutrophication when restoring mangrove wetlands and reducing nitrogen pollution.""

112,"2023 MAR 01 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily Hong Kong Report -- New research on geography is the subject of a new report. According to news reporting out of Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Mangroves, which have extremely high primary productivity, are efficient coastal blue carbon ecosystems. Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important component of vegetation carbon pools.""   Our news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Sun Yat-sen University: ""Thus, accurate estimation of mangrove AGB is critical for studying carbon cycle and climate change. While the practical significance and application of information obtained on mangrove AGB in China is apparent, studies of this nature in China at a national scale have rarely been reported. Remote sensing technology is convenient, efficient, has a wide observational range, and can be used for large-scale ecosystem monitoring. Canopy height is a structural parameter that is positively correlated with the AGB of vegetation. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) satellite, launched in recent years, is able to obtain vegetation canopy height. This study employed forest canopy height derived from GEDI satellite-based LiDAR and an allometric equation based on the allometric theory to estimate mangrove AGB in China in 2019, and the quantitative and spatial distribution of mangrove biomass and their main influencing factors were analyzed. The results showed that the total and mean AGB of mangroves in China in 2019 were about 1,974,827 t and 73.0 t/hm2, respectively. Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao area showed the largest total mangrove AGB, reaching 843,836 t. The mean values of AGB in each province (region) with mangrove ecosystems nationwide ranged from 53.3 to 92.1 t/hm2, of which the largest was found in Hainan Province, reaching 92.1 t/hm2. In Hainan, Taiwan, and Fujian provinces, mean mangrove AGB was higher than the national mean. Considering nature reserves, the mean AGBs of mangroves in Neilingdingdao-Futian and Mai Po mangrove nature reserves in Shenzhen Bay in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao area and Dongzhaigang mangrove nature reserve in Hainan province were relatively high, with values greater than 110 t/hm2. The accumulation and distribution of mangrove AGB in China are affected by latitude and anthropogenic factors.""   According to the news reporters, the research concluded: ""This study provides a comprehensive analysis of mangrove AGB in China based on remote sensing and an allometric equation and can provide a database and technical reference for estimating carbon storage in mangrove ecosystems. It will also contribute to the implementation of ecological restoration and protection measures for coastal mangroves, as well as carbon emission control in China.""

115,"Canberra: Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has issued the following news release: The Australian Government and CSIRO will commence a partnership with Google to combine world-leading artificial intelligence and digital science with cutting-edge climate science to respond to the climate change crisis in the Indo-Pacific. In collaboration with Australia ’ s development program in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, CSIRO has partnered with Google to better understand and utilise blue carbon ecosystems in Indo-Pacific and Australian coastlines. Blue carbon refers to natural carbon sinks, which can play a role in mitigating the increase of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. The research will investigate new ways to accurately monitor, map and report on seagrass and associated biodiversity indicators. Field work has started in in Fiji ’ s Lau Islands and Labuan Bajo in Indonesia. Minister for Industry and Science, Ed Husic, said the collaboration is a great example of CSIRO ’ s work with industry to support the capacity of Australia and our region to respond to climate change. “In many countries, the most vulnerable communities rely on coastal ecosystems for their livelihoods and resilience,” Minister Husic said. “Australian, Fijian and Indonesian researchers will work together to develop sophisticated techniques for gathering data about biodiversity and habitats. “The information can then be used to inform national policies and climate change action. ” Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said Australia recognised the importance of protecting biodiversity to mitigate and build resilience to climate change. “Mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass are blue carbon ecosystems, which provide long-term carbon storage,” Minister Conroy said. “They are also among the most extensive and valuable coastal ecosystems across the Indo-Pacific, providing benefits directly linked to sustainable livelihoods, and climate resilience and adaptation. “This collaboration highlights the Australian Government ’ s commitment to working with our Indo-Pacific partners on important issues, including climate change. ” CSIRO Chief Executive Dr Larry Marshall said the initiative will support climate-smart decisions that strengthen climate resilience and economic growth. “The combination of Google's world-leading AI and platform technology, CSIRO's deep climate, digital and AI expertise, DFAT's experience delivering high-quality development programs, and skills of our in-country partners, will help create tailored and cutting-edge solutions for Australia and the Indo-Pacific,” Dr Marshall said. Mel Silva, Managing Director, Google Australia and New Zealand, said that the partnership had been made possible by the Digital Future Initiative. “The Digital Future Initiative is an investment in the extraordinary talent and creativity of Australians and will allow us to continue working with CSIRO to harness machine learning tools to protect marine fauna and endangered species, and the future of our nation ’ s coastline,” Ms Silva said. “Our shared goal is to support long-term climate resilience and improve access to technology for developing nations in the Indo-Pacific region. ” This partnership will be delivered through Australia ’ s Science and Technology for Climate Partnership (SciTech4Climate) program. It is a $2.7 million investment through DFAT and Google ’ s Digital Future Initiative, including in-kind and funding contributions. BACKGROUND on blue carbon: In August, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek released the first National Ocean Ecosystem Account, which collects information on carbon storage and coastal protection benefits of Australia ’ s mangroves and seagrass, known as blue carbon ecosystems. In June, the Government announced increased support for blue carbon ecosystems by investing $9.5 million to support five new practical restoration projects and endorsed the Joint Declaration on the Creation of a Global Coalition for Blue Carbon. Blue carbon facts: • Australia and our oceans are home to 12% of the world ’ s blue carbon ecosystems. • Blue carbon ecosystems absorb up to five times the carbon dioxide as terrestrial forests.

116,"Cologny: World Economic Forum has issued the following press release: Many academics and private sector groups believe restoring blue carbon habitats can help offset carbon emissions.But the climate benefits are far from certain, and the scale at which they mitigate emissions could have been oversold, argue the authors of new research.They call for more detailed researched into the potential benefits of blue carbon sinks - but highlight the role habitat restoration plays beyond just carbon removal.Removing several hundred billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere is now considered necessary to avert the worst effects of climate change. Using nature to help achieve that goal, by allowing habitats to regenerate, would seem to offer a win-win solution for the environment and the climate. The sediments beneath mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows are rich in organic carbon which has built up over many hundreds of years. Businesses and states keen to offset their emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) are exploring ways to do so by funding the restoration of these so-called blue carbon habitats. Many academics and private sector groups support the idea, assuming that the rate at which these ecosystems remove CO₂ from the atmosphere can be accurately predicted well into the future. We are researchers who study how marine life, chemistry and the climate interact, and after examining the processes by which coastal habitats draw down (and release) planet-warming gases, we ’ re not convinced. Whether the climate benefits from restoring these habitats – by planting mangrove trees, for example – is far from certain, and there ’ s a real risk that the scale at which they can mitigate emissions has been massively oversold. Our new analysis found several reasons why it is extremely difficult to work out a reliable figure for carbon accumulation by coastal ecosystems under current conditions. So we have a very shaky basis for calculating the future carbon offsets that restoration projects might provide over the next 50 to 100 years. Burrowing organisms disturb and mix younger and older layers, causing errors in the carbon dating process. Image: Stephanie Nolte/University of East AngliaCauses of uncertaintyEstimates of the rate at which blue carbon habitats remove CO₂ from the atmosphere vary widely. Across several hundred scientific studies, there was a 600-fold difference between the highest and lowest estimates for carbon burial in saltmarshes, a 76-fold difference for seagrasses and a 19-fold difference for mangroves. Applying the average value from all these studies for a particular habitat is the easiest shortcut to estimate the carbon sequestration that can be expected from a new restoration project. But the variability means that the expected carbon offsetting could be badly wrong. And because there are many low values reported with just a few very high ones, there is a much greater chance of overestimating the climate benefit. Differences in carbon removal rates exist even over distances of just a few kilometers. Many extra measurements are needed for credible carbon accounting, but these take time and effort, raising the cost of a restoration project. Problems run deeper than that. The carbon burial rates reported in studies are usually determined indirectly, by sampling sediment at different depths to estimate its age. Burrowing organisms disturb and mix younger and older layers, causing errors in this dating process by making sediments seem younger, and carbon burial rates greater, than they really are. Much of the carbon buried in coastal sediments comes from elsewhere, such as soil swept from the land and carried by rivers. The proportion of imported carbon can be as little as 10% or as much as 90%. Imported carbon should be excluded from estimates used in offset accounting to clarify how much was buried as a result of restoring the habitat and how much might have simply been buried regardless. Unfortunately, imported carbon may be more resistant to decay. In a study on one saltmarsh, the proportion of 50% imported carbon near the sediment surface increased to 80% in deeper layers. Since the deeper value represents the habitat ’ s long-term carbon burial rate, the direct contribution of a restored habitat to removing carbon may be much less important than thought. Other processes which are difficult to quantify might increase rather than diminish the climate benefits of restoring blue carbon habitats. If plant debris from a coastal habitat is washed out to sea instead of accumulating in the sediment, it could still end up being stored for a long time elsewhere. It might sink to very deep water in the open ocean, for example. But scientists don ’ t know enough about the amounts of carbon typically involved in such processes to properly account for them. Turning an oil palm plantation back into a mangrove forest or flooding a coastal area to make a saltmarsh should help the land accumulate carbon. But that same land could also release more methane (otherwise known as marsh gas) and nitrous oxide – both powerful greenhouse gases – leaving no net climate benefit. That ’ s because these gases are formed when there is insufficient oxygen in the soil or sediment, the same conditions that favour carbon accumulation. Technically demanding measurements are needed to find out exactly what is going on. DISCOVERWhat is the World Economic Forum doing on blue carbon? Show more Turning an oil palm plantation back into a mangrove forest or flooding a coastal area to make a saltmarsh should help the land accumulate carbon. Image: Judith Rosentreter/Southern Cross UniversityAnd then there are calcifying animals and plants which grow in these habitats, particularly seagrass meadows. The strap-like leaves of seagrass are often covered by a white crust of shelled worms and coralline algae. When these organisms make their calcium carbonate covering, CO₂ is produced. At an underwater meadow in Florida, more CO₂ was released than removed by the seagrass itself. At other places, conditions may favour a chemical reaction between dissolved CO₂ and carbonate in the sediment, resulting in extra carbon uptake. Again, sophisticated measurements are needed at each site to sort out the importance of these effects. Shelled worms and coralline algae produce CO₂ when making their calcium carbonate covering. Image: David Luquet/CNRS & Sorbonne UniversitéFinally, there ’ s the future to consider. Will restored coastal ecosystems withstand the ravages of climate change, including heatwaves, storms and sea level rise? And will they be sufficiently well managed to protect against encroachment by agriculture, aquaculture, tourism and other industries and activities that may have caused the habitat to disappear in the first place? Have you read?What is 'Blue Carbon' and how does it help protect our coastal ecosystems?These blue carbon ecosystems could slow climate changeOne of Earth ’ s most biodiverse habitats lies off the Scottish west coast – but climate change could wipe it outEvery effort should still be made to halt, and wherever possible reverse, the worldwide loss of coastal vegetation. Blue carbon habitats are, after all, more than carbon sinks – they also protect communities from storms, nurture biodiversity and species targeted by fisheries, and improve water quality. We fervently hope that future protection of blue carbon habitats will be effective, and that global warming can be kept below the thresholds considered critical for their survival, ranging from 2.3°C to 3.7°C above pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, that is far from certain. And if those temperature thresholds are exceeded, newly accumulated stores of carbon may be returned to the atmosphere when the vegetation is no longer there to prevent the sediment eroding. Since the scale of long-term carbon removal and storage by blue carbon habitats is so uncertain, it is too risky to rely on as a means of offsetting continued emissions. The consequences of failing to deliver are too great. The priority must therefore be to double down on emission reductions, only using carbon removal methods to help achieve net zero where we are confident that they will work.

117,"(TNSres) -- The Nature Conservancy issued the following news release: Planet Labs PBC (NYSE: PL), a leading provider of daily data and insights about Earth, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a global environmental organization dedicated to conserving the lands and waters on which all life depends, today announced collaborative efforts on the Blue Carbon Explorer (BlueCarbon.TNC.org), a digital tool developed by TNC that aims to map mangrove and seagrass blue carbon around the world. The tool also enables governments and coastal managers to make data-informed decisions on the protection and restoration of coastal ecosystems. Blue carbon refers to carbon stored in marine environments like seagrasses, mangroves, and salt marshes. Notably, blue carbon ecosystems can store up to 5 times as much carbon as upland forests. The world's mangroves alone sequester more than 31 million tons of carbon in their soils and biomass each year. With this in mind, both TNC and Planet believe that the protection and restoration of these environments is critical for supporting biodiversity, combating climate change and helping communities to thrive. New tools to map, monitor, and quantify these ecosystems are key for their conservation. ""These ecosystems really are a great ocean-climate link, and part of our strategy is to unlock this blue carbon potential for climate mitigation,"" said Lindsey Smart, Climate and Ocean Scientist at TNC. The Blue Carbon Explorer is a Google Earth Engine app developed by TNC that leverages field-collected data from drone and satellite imagery, including Planet's SkySat and PlanetScope imagery, to help identify key areas for restoration and protection. The tool helps to visualize if these ecosystems are degraded or healthy, enabling analysts to determine the best management decisions to aid in their conservation and restoration. ""Thousands of PlanetScope scenes were used to derive the high-resolution mangrove and seagrass extent layers that the Blue Carbon Explorer relies on to perform analyses of temporal changes in habitat health and extract data on canopy height,"" said Valerie Pietsch McNulty, Conservation Scientist for TNC's Caribbean Division. ""Planet's data has been a game-changer for decision-making due to its high resolution because restoration sites can be very small, so having this level of granularity in the spatial data allows us to really target specific areas, within expansive mangrove patches."" This collaborative work has already started to reveal insights into changing coastal habitats throughout the Caribbean, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. For governments, the maps have revealed previously unknown regions of mangrove and seagrass habitats, helping them better account for their natural resources and potential blue carbon stocks. Leveraging Planet data and new techniques in artificial intelligence (AI), as well as lessons learned from the Blue Carbon Explorer, these insights can be used to better understand coastal habitats around the world. ""Mapping coastal blue carbon is a critical step in securing these vital carbon stocks - and the immense social, ecological, climatological and economic value they represent,"" said Planet's Chief Impact Officer Andrew Zolli. ""By combining TNC's expertise with Planet's breakthrough Earth observation capabilities, the Blue Carbon Explorer makes these benefits visible and accessible to a wide variety of stakeholders. It's a vital tool for advancing a scientifically rigorous, just, and inclusive transition to a more climate-stabilized future."" TNC's Smart noted, ""In terms of carbon accounting, we really need high resolution globally consistent datasets because these systems are pretty dynamic. It's important to accurately quantify the carbon sequestered and stored in these systems and the changes through time. The fact that Planet data can be leveraged to do these things is a huge value add, especially for scaling blue carbon market projects."" The process for developing the Blue Carbon Explorer deeply emphasized the role and needs of local stakeholders. The TNC team conducted extensive workshops and research with local communities and government leaders in building the tool and applying it to scale-up restoration efforts on the ground. ""When prioritizing where to restore coastal habitats, it is critical to include the people component and identify areas where climate change is having the most impact,"" said Steve Schill, Lead Scientist for the Caribbean at TNC. ""By evaluating these important coastal ecosystems with satellite data, we can zero in on the areas where the resilience of a coastal community can be improved and the benefits of coastal protection and enhanced livelihoods and human well-being are aligned."" * * * Original text here: https://www.nature.org/en-us/newsroom/blue-carbon-explorer-tnc-planet-collaboration/ [Category: Environment] Contact: Karen Foerstel, 917/652-2642. kfoerstel@tnc.org Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8122306 MSTRUCK Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: BLUE ECONOMY (90%); COASTAL AREAS (90%); COASTAL CONSERVATION (90%); CONSERVATION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); LAND CONSERVATION (90%); NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION (90%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (90%); COASTAL AREA MANAGEMENT (89%); ECOSYSTEMS & HABITATS (89%); ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); BIODIVERSITY (78%); ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION (78%); MARINE CONSERVATION (78%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); WETLANDS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); GEOSPATIAL DATA (77%); LAND RECLAMATION (77%); NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); BIOMASS (72%); CLIMATOLOGY (72%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (70%) Organization: NATURE CONSERVANCY (94%) Industry: BLUE ECONOMY (90%); MARINE CONSERVATION (78%); GEOSPATIAL DATA (77%); BIOMASS (72%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (70%) Geographic: VIRGINIA, USA (79%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (91%); INDONESIA (79%); PAPUA NEW GUINEA (79%)"

119,"SETOUCHI, Kagoshima -- Efforts have begun to expand mangrove colonies in the town of Setouchi in the southern part of Amami-Oshima island, which was registered as a World Natural Heritage site last year. The town government declared last July that it would achieve net-zero emissions for carbon dioxide by 2050. To this end, the town has been planting seeds since mid-June and growing about 300 mangrove seedlings at three locations, including the town hall, as mangroves are believed to absorb CO2 at a high rate. The seedlings will be planted in autumn this year. Carbon dioxide absorbed and fixed by plants on land is known as ""green carbon,"" while carbon stored in oceans by marine plants is called ""blue carbon."" Mangrove trees grow in dense forests where freshwater and seawater mix and are considered one of the main drivers of blue carbon formation. The town government on July 5 invited media from Tokyo and Fukuoka to a seed planting event at a local coworking space to promote the town's efforts. The participants sowed seeds of mehirugi (Kandelia obovata) -- a common mangrove species in Japan -- or rather, stuck them into pots because the seeds are elongated in shape. ""To enrich the ocean's resources, we hope to make this a long-lasting project while expanding our knowledge,"" said a town official.

120,"2023 FEB 28 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Climate Change Daily News -- New research on Climate Change is the subject of a report. According to news reporting out of Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx editors, research stated, ""Significant efforts have been invested to restore mangrove forests worldwide through reforestation and afforestation. However, blue carbon benefit has not been compared between these two silvicultural pathways at the global scale.""   Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Tsinghua University, ""Here, we integrated results from direct field measurements of over 370 restoration sites around the world to show that mangrove reforestation (reestablishing mangroves where they previously colonized) had a greater carbon storage potential per hectare than afforestation (establishing mangroves where not previously mangrove). Greater carbon accumulation was mainly attributed to favorable intertidal positioning, higher nitrogen availability, and lower salinity at most reforestation sites. Reforestation of all physically feasible areas in the deforested mangrove regions of the world could promote the uptake of 671.5-688.8 Tg CO-eq globally over a 40-year period, 60% more than afforesting the same global area on tidal flats (more marginal sites).""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""Along with avoiding conflicts of habitat conversion, mangrove reforestation should be given priority when designing nature-based solutions for mitigating global climate change.""

Lower porewater salinity would, however, increase mangrove $${E}_{c}$$ E c -to- $$ET$$ ET ratios by affecting leaf-, tree-, and stand-level eco-physiological controls on transpiration. Restricted water use is also additive to other ecosystem services provided by mangroves, such as high carbon sequestration, coastal protection and support of biodiversity within estuarine and marine environments. Low freshwater demand enables mangroves to sustain ecological values of connected estuarine ecosystems with future reductions in freshwater while not competing with the freshwater needs of humans.""

122,"Link to Image Link to Story Abu Dhabi, 18th January 2022: Yesterday during a virtual session at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, Her Excellency Dr Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) stressed on the importance of conservation of the environment and sequestering carbon to achieve sustainable development.  During her video she shared insights and examples of initiatives and projects undertaken by EAD to help preserve mangroves to combat climate change. She said:""One major programme we have worked on at EAD is the Blue Carbon Project. Blue Carbon refers to the ability of coastal vegetation to store carbon. Blue carbon ecosystems, which include mangrove forests, saltmarshes, and seagrass beds, store and sequester carbon in biomass and sediments.  If these ecosystems are destroyed, buried carbon can be released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change and ocean acidification. This means we should strive to always keep these ecosystems intact."" She added:""The UAE was one of the first countries to recognize the importance of coastal habitats, and mangrove restoration and conservation efforts have been implemented since the 1970s.  ""This national affinity to the sea led to the initiation of the Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon Demonstration Project in 2012, which was led by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI) together with EAD and illustrated the full potential of coastal ecosystems in Abu Dhabi.  ''The success of the project prompted the initiation of Phase II, known as the National Blue Carbon Project in 2015, which extended the understanding and valuation aspects of coastal Blue Carbon ecosystem services, particularly in mangroves, in the Northern and Eastern regions of the UAE."" She concluded:""More recently, the UAE Mangroves Annual Carbon Sequestration trial study was completed to assess soil carbon sequestration rates of UAE mangroves. The study found that the mangroves of the UAE sequester carbon at a rate of 0.5 tons per hectare per year, in addition to the carbon stocks stored within mangrove tree biomass. These rates are far higher compared to terrestrial soils of arid regions and other reported mangrove soil carbon sequestration rates around the Arabian Peninsula."" Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) is a global platform for accelerating the world's sustainable development. Since its inception in 2008, ADSW has focused on delivering action across three principles: Global Collaboration & Leadership, Economic Development, and Technology & Innovation.

123,"SHARM EL SHEIKH, 8th November,2022 (WAM) -- Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, today announced the launch of the Mangrove Alliance for Climate (MAC). Led by the UAE and Indonesia, the initiative seeks to scale up and accelerate the conservation and restoration of mangrove ecosystems for the benefit of communities worldwide. The announcement took place at the 27th UN Climate Change Conference (COP27), running in Egypt from 6th to 18th November. Five other countries - India, Sri Lanka, Australia, Japan, and Spain - have joined the Alliance. MAC seeks to raise awareness about the role of mangroves as a nature-based climate change solution, and, through its members, will work towards expanding and rehabilitating mangrove forests globally. Mangrove forests are among the most productive and ecologically important ecosystems on earth. They offer significant climate change mitigation and adaptation co-benefits, as they store carbon up to 400 percent faster than land-based tropical rainforests, protect coasts from rising sea levels, erosion, and storm surges, and provide breeding grounds for marine biodiversity. Around 80 percent of the global fish population depend on healthy mangrove ecosystems. Mariam Almheiri said, ""Increasing reliance on nature-based solutions is an integral element of the UAE's climate action on the domestic as well as international level, therefore we seek to expand our mangrove cover. At COP26, we presented our ambitious target of planting 100 million mangroves by 2030."" ""We are pleased to launch MAC jointly with Indonesia, and believe it will go a long way in driving collective climate action and rehabilitating blue carbon ecosystems,"" she added. The Minister noted that the UAE intends to plant three million mangroves within the next two months. At the MAC launch ceremony, the website https://mangrovealliance4climate.org , which features the alliance's goals, work mechanisms, and a pledge form for members, went live. MAC will follow a voluntary approach. Members can determine their own commitments towards planting and restoring mangrove forests, promoting multilateral cooperation, and sharing knowledge, while the Alliance will support their projects in the areas of mangrove research, management and protection of coastal areas, and educating the public about climate change mitigation and adaptation. Collectively, members will demonstrate their dedication to maximising the potential of nature-based solutions through mangrove planting and conservation campaigns, enhance mangroves' climate change mitigation capabilities through research and innovation, contribute to mangrove conservation worldwide through scientific and socio-economic studies, engage the community and the private sector in mangrove planting to expand blue carbon ecosystems, and step up concerted efforts to advance the global climate agenda. MAC will feature multiple interactive platforms, including annual meetings to track progress in implementing its goals, drive cooperation between members, and approve annual reports.

124,"(TNSjou) -- The University of California-San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography issued the following news: * * * From San Diego to the Galapagos Islands and beyond, Scripps Oceanography researchers are revealing the mysteries of carbon sequestration in aquatic ecosystems * * * Marine scientist Matthew Costa is used to digging into research--literally. Over the course of his PhD program at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Costa frequently muddied his hands while collecting more than 100 sediment cores from mangrove forests across Latin America. He and other researchers have turned their attention to these sediment cores to better understand how mangrove ecosystems sequester carbon dioxide, a planet-warming greenhouse gas. This work can then inform local and global efforts that aim to use and restore such ocean and coastal ""blue carbon"" ecosystems as a possible solution in the fight against climate change. A special issue of the journal Limnology and Oceanography, published Nov. 30, details new research led by Costa, who graduated from Scripps in 2019. In the paper, he and several co-authors from Scripps Oceanography, UC Riverside, and other research organizations describe their work examining mangrove sediment carbon stocks across regions. While aquatic ecosystems have the ability to trap tons of carbon for thousands of years, little is known about what controls how much carbon is stored in one particular region over another. To uncover this mystery, Costa and colleagues sampled sediments from 80 sites across diverse mangrove environments, including the arid Baja Peninsula of Mexico, the volcanic Galapagos Islands, and the geologically and climatically distinct Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Panama. One of their key findings was that variation in maximum sediment depth--ranging from seven to 427 centimeters (2.8 to 168 inches) across sites--largely explained variation in carbon stocks in those areas. These results underscore the importance of using measurements of sediment depth to estimate carbon stock. ""There's a lot of local variation in how much carbon is buried beneath those mangroves, and the most important contributor to that variation is just how deep the sediment goes,"" said Costa, now a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University and a visiting scholar at Scripps Oceanography. ""Some studies ignore this variable, but it's essential to understanding both the history of how these sites attained these carbon stocks and where we should place the highest priority in protecting and managing them to keep mitigating climate change."" In measuring carbon storage, researchers typically look at carbon density--how much carbon is in the sediment per unit volume--and then scale that up to quantify how much sediment there is in an area. Costa noted that many studies just make those measurements based on the first half meter or so of sediment, and then scale up. But in analyzing sediment cores in diverse and remote environments in Latin America, the research team exposed the enormous variation in sediment depths across each area. For example, within the different regions, such as the Galapagos, they found a ""huge amount"" of variation in sediment depth within sites that were only a few miles apart. Costa said this research is significant as the team has added to the range of environments in which there are now data on carbon storage in mangroves. By increasing these local measurements, the research community can better map out estimates of carbon storage across study sites, and in turn help inform habitat protection efforts. Study co-author Paula Ezcurra said this research is unique in that it utilizes datasets of belowground carbon in mangrove sediments across vastly different settings. ""The results highlight that although we're looking at similar ecosystems--i.e. coastal mangrove forests in Latin America--there exists a wide range of climatic and geological conditions under which mangrove forests can thrive,"" said Ezcurra, a former staff research associate at Scripps Oceanography who is now the science program manager at the Climate Science Alliance. ""These differences affect each forest's ability to sequester and store organic carbon in their soils--something we know to be beneficial in the mitigation of climate change and reduction of atmospheric carbon."" Connection to Local Wetlands While the new paper focuses on mangrove ecosystems, the findings can be applied to research on other coastal ecosystems known for blue carbon storage, such as salt marshes and seagrass beds. Upon graduating from Scripps Oceanography in 2019, Costa began working as a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation (CCCIA) at Scripps Oceanography, focusing his research on local subtidal blue carbon ecosystems--meaning carbon that was buried in environments completely underwater, such as the seagrass beds and canyons off La Jolla. He also started examining carbon sequestration in protected and restored wetlands across San Diego County. As part of this work, Costa has been collaborating with researchers at WILDCOAST--a non-profit dedicated to ecosystem conservation--and the San Diego Audubon Society to build baseline blue carbon datasets for San Diego's wetlands. He has already engaged in extensive fieldwork to collect sediment cores from key sites including San Dieguito Lagoon, Famosa Slough, and Kendall-Frost Mission Bay Marsh Reserve, which is part of the University of California Natural Reserve System. ""We know that coastal wetlands are valuable for both the long-term carbon storage and the many other ecosystem services they provide,"" said Mary Liesegang, blue carbon conservation manager at WILDCOAST. ""The research collaboration between WILDCOAST and Scripps is important because it provides an opportunity to quantify that value in terms of carbon storage. These results allow us to determine the most effective restoration practices and policy to ensure that coastal wetlands remain a carbon sink for years to come."" Similar to observations seen in remote mangrove ecosystems, Costa has found sediment variability in San Diego's urban estuaries, noting that one side of an estuary might have sediment only 15 centimeters deep while the other side might go three meters deep. The new study shows that these wide variations in depth need to be considered in any calculations of carbon stock. ""The most important variable that controls how much carbon is stored in coastal wetlands, whether it's a mangrove or another ecosystem like a salt marsh, is very simply how much carbon-rich sediment there is,"" Costa explained. In coastal cities where wetlands are both the most threatened by and the most needed to mitigate climate impacts, Costa said it is especially valuable to get more local measurements to map out the belowground landscape. This will help researchers to better understand how the resource of wetland carbon is distributed around this part of the California coast. ""These findings will be extremely useful to stakeholders for coastal planning, conservation, and restoration, particularly in high-priority areas,"" said Costa. Those data are still being collected and prepared, but the researchers hope to share results soon. In addition to Costa and Paula Ezcurra, co-authors of the Limnology and Oceanography paper are Exequiel Ezcurra with UC Riverside; Joy Kumagai, James Leichter, and Octavio Aburto-Oropeza with Scripps Oceanography; Pelayo Salinas-de-Leon with theCharles Darwin Foundation; and Benjamin Turner, who is currently affiliated with the University of Florida Gainesville. Costa's PhD field work was supported by the Helmsley Charitable Trust, the NSF Graduate Research Internship Program, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Short-Term Fellowship. His sampling in the Baja Peninsula and sample analysis was supported by the Mia Tegner Memorial Fellowship and the UC Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS) dissertation research grant programs. * * * JOURNAL: Limnology and Oceanography https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/19395590/2022/67/S2 * * * Original text here: https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/scientists-dig-sediments-clues-carbon-storage Copyright Targeted News Services MSTRUCK-8010790 MSTRUCK Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newswire Subject: OCEANOGRAPHY (95%); EARTH & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (91%); CARBON CAPTURE & STORAGE (90%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (90%); ISLANDS & REEFS (90%); OCEANOGRAPHIC & ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES (90%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); BLUE ECONOMY (78%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (78%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (78%); MARINE BIOLOGY (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); BIOLOGY (77%); GEOLOGY & GEOPHYSICS (77%); GREENHOUSE GASES (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); WRITERS (67%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (52%) Organization: UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (84%) Industry: BLUE ECONOMY (78%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (78%); GRADUATE & PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); WRITERS (67%) Geographic: SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (94%); RIVERSIDE, CA, USA (79%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); PACIFIC OCEAN (79%); ECUADOR (90%); LATIN AMERICA (90%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (79%); MEXICO (79%)"
125,"Blue Carbon Society (BCS) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at the United Nations Conference Centre (UNCC) to develop a masterplan to sustainably nurture 24 km2 of mangroves in the western Thai province of Phetchaburi. Phetchaburi is home to one of the world's most biodiverse marine environments. But urbanization and coastal activities such as salt farming have had mixed impacts on coastal ecosystems. To date, 17% of the province's mangroves remain untouched. Blue Carbon Society's co-founders, Dr. Jwanwat and Mrs. Thippaporn Ahriyavraromp, said the masterplan would aim at sustainable well-being for people as well as plants and animals. The partnership will find ways for humans and the rest of nature to co-exist happily, said Dr. Jwanwat. Mangrove forests not only serve the well-being of our planet. They are also vital for local communities. Biodiversity-rich mangroves are nurseries and hatching grounds for species that are key resources for fishery and tourism. A key goal of the masterplan is thus to empower local communities to be custodians of their mangroves. Blue Carbon Society commits on implementing this 3 year-year project in collaboration with UNDP. The initiative is expected to complement the development plan of the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMRC) under Thailand's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. The Masterplan project aims to create a world-class 'Urban Mangrove Forest Showcase' at East Bang Taboon. This showcase will turn 400,000 sqm of mangrove forest into an inspiring model of ecotourism and sustainable development. Reclamation here will also tackle river-borne plastic waste, which is known to harm marine animals such as Bryde's whales. The project includes a further 'pilot' reclamation at Pak Thale to find ways to sustainably rehabilitate salt farm areas. Lovita Ramguttee, UNDP Resident Representative a.i. said the project could provide huge benefits for Thailand's coasts and seas. The Masterplan will address the biggest barriers to preserving critical coastal ecosystems, she said. We need to involve local communities and local government in developing and implementing the project from the start. UNDP can play an important role in engaging stakeholders locally and globally in knowledge sharing and implementation. These efforts will contribute to the achievements of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), especially SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life below Water) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Blue Carbon Society and UNDP will work with local stakeholders, public bodies, and experts from MQDC's Research & Innovation for Sustainability Center (RISC) and DTGO Corporation Limited's Urban Action Team in implementing this project. The agreements to create the Masterplan were signed for Blue Carbon Society by Dr. Jwanwat and Mrs. Thippaporn Ahriyavraromp, its President and Vice-President, and by Dr.Wit Soontaranun, Director and Treasurer. UNDP was represented by Lovita Ramguttee, Resident Representative a.i. and Mr. Saengroj Srisawaskraisorn, Team Leader of UNDP Inclusive Green Growth and Sustainable Development Unit. About Thailand's mangroves Mangrove forests rank among the world's most important but most threatened ecosystems. Mangroves play a vital role in combating climate change, storing about 1,000 tonnes of carbon in each hectare. They also provide homes and feeding grounds for many land and sea species. They support coastal communities and protect from ocean swell and extreme weather. Thailand's coasts have about 1,900 km2 of mangroves. These forests help the country maintain its exceptional biodiversity, hosting 9% of all species known to science. Thailand has already lost 84% of its mangroves, the greatest decrease for any nation. But the rate of loss has slowed with restoration work since the 2004 tsunami. The 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP) for 2017-21 aims to increase mangrove area as part of raising nationwide forest cover from 33% to 40%. Phetchaburi's mangroves cover 14,839 rai (24 km2) or 17.27% of its area. These forests provide a habitat for 42% of the species in the upper Gulf of Thailand. The coast combines mangrove forests, mudflats, and sandy beaches with a relatively shallow seabed (averaging 45 meters) that receives a high influx of nutrients and freshwater from Phetchaburi river and canals. There are 74 shorebirds, including rare migratory species that attract birdwatchers. Phetchaburi is Thailand's biggest producer of lime, sea salt, and is famous for its ark shells. The coast here also has strong potential in ecotourism, agriculture, and coastal fisheries development. About Blue Carbon Society Blue Carbon Society Association (BCS) was co-founded by Dr. Jwanwat and Mrs. Thippaporn Ahriyavraromp as a community of friends who wish to protect and conserve marine and coastal (or blue carbon) ecosystems that help counter climate change. BCS aims at inspiring global action to improve the capacity of marine and coastal ecosystems to combat climate change by creating programs/activities that help human communities and natural ecosystems to co-exist in a balanced way, developing human capital and knowledge hub for sustaining marine and coastal biodiversity and ecosystems, and creating a network of alliances for blue carbon.

126,"The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is bringing every blue carbon asset to fight against climate change-related hazards and harm. Looking out onto a tranquil coastal marsh, many people would never guess that, beneath its windswept grasses, plants buried deep in the soil have captured and stored vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. In the race to lessen the damage of climate change, this blue carbon held in the nations coastal ecosystems is a powerful ally. It incentivises restoration projects and can be traded on global carbon financial markets, which balance projects that feature emissions with contributions that take carbon out of the atmosphere. Blue carbon also plays an important green role in the US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which directs more than $12 billion dollars to advance carbon capture and removal projects. NOAAs National Estuarine Research Reserves are leading the way on the blue carbon front, joined by partners across the public-private spectrum that include the non-profit Restore Americas Estuaries. Research reserve leaders believe so much in applying blue carbon science that their Science Collaborative programme (co-led by the University of Michigan) has helped fund most of the projects described below. Whats more, NOAAs land cover programme ensured that blue carbon is included in the US greenhouse gas emissions inventory. The following examples represent ongoing blue-carbon-related efforts throughout the research reserve system. Pioneering products travel far Bringing Wetlands to Market, created by the Waquoit Bay Research Reserve in Massachusetts, was the first-ever US tool and guide on marketing the blue carbon stored in coastal wetlands. The Mission-Aransas Research Reserve in Texas adapted Bringing Wetlands to Market, presenting it to 318 participants in three cities and four additional research reserves in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. A video gives viewers the skinny on blue carbon. In Massachusetts and at least five other states, a blue carbon curriculum featured through Teachers on the Estuary workshops has reached 100-plus teachers who have educated more than 2,000 students. The Waquoit Bay Reserve and their partners discovered that restoring tidal flow to restricted or degraded marshes reduces emissions of the greenhouse gas methane. These early methane findings have been studied by other reserves. Today, the reserve is partnering with the US Environmental Protection Agency on a framework to help New England policymakers incorporate blue carbon considerations into state greenhouse gas policies. Reserve hosts carbon-offset first and mangrove restoration Last year, the Philadelphia Eagles pro football team agreed to restore seagrasses and mangroves at NOAAs Jobos Bay Research Reserve in Puerto Rico as a way to offset carbon emissions stemming from team travel. The Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Foundation are project partners. Another project, the Mangrove Coast Collaborative, has already begun to increase healthy mangrove forests at this reserve and the Rookery Bay Research Reserve in Florida. The collaborative solicits community input and then delivers maps, assessments, and decision-science insights.

127,"2023 APR 05 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology Daily News -- A new study on environmental protection is now available. According to news reporting originating from West Bengal, India, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, ""One of the most productive and supportive ecosystems, the mangroves, have faced a sharp decline of 1.04 million hectares globally, mostly due to population pressure and environmental changes related to the recent effects of global warming and climate change.""   Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Vivekananda College: ""The loss of area, species migration, altered ecological services etc. are among the most discussed concerns, as evident from the volumes of literatures. However, these issues have overshadowed the fact that along with biodiversity, globally we are losing an important and efficient carbon sink - the mangrove lands. The lost mangrove patches and their conversion to aquaculture, agriculture, or simply settlement areas significantly alter the carbon budget. Sometimes conversion of mangroves to agriculture or aquaculture farms even reverses the roles and the sink has been reported to have become a source of carbon - alternatively known as blue carbon emission. This article provides an overview of the impacts of coastal aquacultures, particularly established in expense of mangrove lands and its consequence on global carbon budget.""   According to the news editors, the research concluded: ""It has been observed that this globally predominant land use change practices not only significantly reduce the carbon sink capacity but also frequently act as indirect source of the same.""

128,"UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31 -- The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization issued the following news release: By Benno Boer, Miguel Cl&#252;sener-Godt, Shahbaz Khan & Hiroyuki Matsuda To read the published version in ThePrint click here Climate Change is a reality. The 27 Climate Summits (UNFCCC/COPs) took place in Sharm El-Sheikh, with the far-reaching launch of ""High Quality Blue Carbon Market Principles and Guidance"", has brought new focus to nature-based solutions. The next COP is to take place in Dubai, November 2023. Whatever these important summits have achieved, human induced climate change is ongoing, especially via CO2 emissions by burning massive amounts of coal, oil, and gas, with its escalating adverse impacts and climate risks related to water-, energy, and food-security, biodiversity and human health. Climate change and rising seawater levels are already changing many of the coastal areas of the world and affecting the living conditions of local populations. This change can go along with an increase or decrease of precipitations, having in consequence a heavy impact on coastal zone management, shore protection, carbon sequestration and accumulation of organic matter in the soil. The production of food, feed, fiber, fuel, and other economic purposes can change irreversibly. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor ongoing processes and collect reliable scientific data to seek nature-based solutions for a sustainable future. As part of the international climate debate, it is of the utmost importance to find solutions, and test and apply them, to mitigate climate change, and to make communities world-wide more climate resilient. It is believed that nature-based solutions will play a critical role. Ecosystems, that are capable of sequestering large amounts of atmospheric and oceanic carbon are of great importance. Because of this importance, a relatively new scientific term has been minted in the recent past 'Blue Carbon Ecosystems'. Blue carbon refers to the color of marine and coastal systems, including various types of saline wetlands, such as, for example, semi-subhydric salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass/seaweed beds, that are periodically or permanently inundated by seawater, and capable of storing large amounts of carbon in their biomass and in water-logged sediments. The term has been used for a little more than ten years, and no comprehensive definition of the term has been developed and agreed on by the scientific community yet. Other blue carbon ecosystems may include, arguably, macro-algal reefs, kelp forests, phytoplankton, benthic communities, coastal peatland systems, coastal sabkhat and deltaic reedbeds. What makes the overall picture even more complex is the fact that some of these systems might actually not function as a carbon-sink, depending on topography, environmental conditions, and the type and depth of the host-sediments. In order to shed light onto the complexity of the sequestration-capacities of these systems, and provide accurate scientific data, it is highly important to differentiate these capacities within and between ecosystems, because a mangrove forest in location A does not equal a mangrove forest in location B . There is an urgent need to synthesize existing scientific information through international efforts, in order to anticipate possible changes and consequences for the well-being of humanity, also in view of carbon-financing. UNESCO Chairs dealing with the scientific investigation of natural habitats, such as the UNESCO Chair on Education in Biosphere Reserves for Sustainable Societies at the Yokohama National University in Japan, the UNESCO Chair on South-South Cooperation for Sustainable Development in Brazil, the UNESCO Chair on Biodiversity Safeguard for Sustainable Development in Portugal, the Great Sandy Biosphere Reserve in Australia, together with the University of Tokyo, the Nanzan University, the Asia Climate Change Education Center in South-Korea, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the Leibniz-Centre for Martine Tropical Research and University of Bremen, the International Society for Mangrove Ecosystems (ISME), the International Society for Halophyte Utilization (ISHU), Saudi ARAMCO, Urban Design Center at Yokohama (UDC-SEA), and supported by JICA and UNESCO, organized a 'Blue Carbon Forum' at Yokohama in January 2023. https://ebross.ynu.ac.jp/research/events/int-conf-bluecarbon/ The forum brought together carbon stakeholders, in presence and online, and will produce a new global scientific book series to be published at the Springer Nature publishing house, called 'Blue Carbon Ecosystems for Sustainable Development', The first two volumes are in the making. The forum findings aim at reaching out to scientists, land-users, politicians, development banks, innovative farmers, investors, energy-producers, and carbon-off-setters from all over the world. The findings of the forum and the new book series will be major scientific contributions for the support of the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals especially for advancing blue carbon as part of climate change tools for a better planet. Major attention will be given to UNESCO designated sites, i. e. Natural World Heritage Sites, Biosphere Reserves and Geoparks, of which many are located on islands and in coastal areas. As the problems emanating from climate change and sea-level rise are becoming even more important, islands and coastal areas are the first confronted with these phenomena. Biosphere Reserves and other designated areas implemented by UNESCO are the ideal tools to monitor these changes and to elaborate strategies for mitigating and adapting to these changes, and consequently a direct implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, the Aichi Targets and the Actions stipulated in the Lima Action Plan for Biosphere Reserves 2016-2025, as well as the recently adopted Global Biodiversity Framework. ****** Benno Boer is the Natural Sciences Specialist of the UNESCO New Delhi Office, which covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka.

129,"Dubbing mangrove forests the ""most productive ecosystems"" of the world, India on Tuesday joined the Mangrove Alliance for Climate (MAC) at the 27th Summit of the Conference of Parties (COP27) at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. UAE, Indonesia, Australia, Japan, Spain and Sri Lanka are the other MAC supporters. Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav said that the mangroves can absorb four to five times more carbon emissions than the tropical forests and can help create new carbon sinks. ""India can contribute to the global knowledge base due to its extensive experience in mangrove restoration, studies on ecosystem valuation, and carbon sequestration,"" Yadav said. What are mangrove forests? A mangrove is a shrub or a small tree that grows along the coastlines and has roots in salty sediments, often underwater. They also grow in swamps. Mangrove forests can survive extreme weather conditions and require low oxygen levels to survive.  The mangroves cannot survive freezing temperatures and thus are found mainly in tropical and subtropical latitudes. Sundarbans in West Bengal in India is the largest mangrove forest in the world.  UNESCO celebrates July 26 as the International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem to raise awareness about mangrove ecosystems and to promote their conservation. What is the Mangrove Alliance for Climate (MAC)? Spearheaded by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in partnership with Indonesia, MAC was launched at the COP27 Summit in Egypt to scale up and accelerate the conservation and restoration of the mangrove forests. The alliance will raise awareness about the role of mangroves as a ""nature-based solution to climate change"". The alliance will be amplified at the G20 Summit that will be held between November 15 and 16 in Bali under the presidency of Indonesia. ""The MAC seeks to scale up, accelerate conservation, restoration and growing plantation efforts of mangrove ecosystems for the benefit of communities globally, and recognize the importance of these ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation,"" MAC's official website said about its aim. How are the Mangroves beneficial? According to MAC, Mangrove forests can store ten times more carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests. Also, they can store carbon up to 400 per cent faster than land-based tropical rainforests. According to Global Mangrove Alliance (GMA), when the mangroves are cut, the carbon stored in these plants gets released into the air. So, preserving them to keep the carbon emissions levels low is necessary. Once the plants die, they take the stored carbon into the soil. This is called ""Blue Carbon"". Moreover, Mangrove forests act as natural barriers against rising tides and storms. Each year, they prevent property damages of over $65 billion. ""They also provide breeding grounds for marine biodiversity and 80% of global fish populations depend on healthy mangrove ecosystems,"" MAC's website read. What is the relationship between India and mangroves? India contributes to nearly half of the total mangrove cover in South Asia. According to the Forest Survey report 2021 released in January, mangroves cover in the country is 4,992 square km, which is 0.15 per cent of the country's total geographical area. Since 2019, the cover has risen by only 17 sq km. West Bengal has the highest percentage of mangrove cover in India, mainly because it has Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world. It is followed by Gujarat and Andaman, and Nicobar islands. Other states that have mangrove cover are Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Kerala.

President Xi Jinping proposed the idea to build an international mangrove center in Shenzhen in his speech via video during the COP14’s opening ceremony Nov. 5.  Shenzhen has vowed to advance the high-quality preparatory work on the center’s establishment and enhance international exchanges and cooperation on ecological protection and governance, according to a city government meeting held Nov. 8.  Lei Guangchun, board chair of Shenzhen Mangrove Wetlands Conservation Foundation (MCF), told the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily that the building of the mangrove center is highly significant to conservation, restoration, scientific research and sustainability of mangroves worldwide.  “Mangroves are a globally endangered wetland ecosystem that plays a key role in global biodiversity, and many species such as birds and fish depend on mangroves for living. The building of the Shenzhen center shows China’s sense of duty in participating in global governance and promoting wetland protection as a responsible major country,” Lei said.   Chris Rostron, international engagement manager of the U.K.’s leading wetland conservation charity Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: “We support China’s proposal to build an international mangrove center as mangroves play an important role when it comes to carbon capture and storage as well as reduction.” (Continued on P3) Classification Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Newspaper Subject: WETLANDS (91%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (90%); CONSERVATION (90%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); WETLANDS CONSERVATION (89%); BIODIVERSITY (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (78%); LAND RECLAMATION (78%); TRENDS & EVENTS (78%); BLUE ECONOMY (76%); COASTAL CONSERVATION (76%); ECOLOGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (76%); SUSTAINABILITY (76%); CIVIC & SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS (75%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (75%); CARBON CAPTURE & STORAGE (71%); SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES (71%); CITY GOVERNMENT (67%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (67%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (67%); CITIES (52%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (51%) Industry: BLUE ECONOMY (76%) Person: XI JINPING (59%) Geographic: SHENZHEN, GUANGDONG, CHINA (94%); BEIJING, CHINA (59%); SOUTH CHINA (74%); NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (59%); CHINA (90%); UNITED KINGDOM (74%); China"
